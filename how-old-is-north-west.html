Probably not.</p><p>Part of the youngest generation of Kardashian-Jenners, North West’s social media presence has been entertaining ever since she was born.</p><p>Kim Kardashian recently <a href=#>revealed</a> nobody intimates her more than her 8-year-old daughter.</p><p>Despite her years in the entertainment world and amongst the rich and famous, <a href=#>Kardashian</a> admitted that her eldest child was the person she was most afraid of crossing.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>North West’s Name Made Headlines</strong></h2><p>North West was born to Kim Kardashian and rapper<a href=#> Kanye West</a> on June 15, 2013.</p><p>While pregnant, Kardashian was adamant that her daughter be named after the point on the compass, a decision that was made fun of all across social media.</p><p>Grandmother Kris Jenner was quick to slam the critics, <a href=#>saying</a>:</p><p><strong>“I love the name North. I’m pro-North, absolutely. “The way [Kim] explained it to me, north means highest power, and North is their highest point together. I thought that was really sweet.”</strong></p><p>Before she was even born, North West was a controversial figure, as Kardashian was still married to Kris Humphries during the pregnancy.</p><p>The reality star has been vocal about the complications she faced during her first two pregnancies.</p><p>When expecting North West, she experienced pre-eclampsia, a complication that arises from high blood pressure that can severely damage organs, having to deliver her daughter at 34 weeks.</p><p>Kardashian then underwent surgery to remove the placenta and scar tissue that had been damaged by placenta accreta after delivery.</p><p>North West’s labor was induced, and she was only seen on Keeping Up With The Kardashians close to her second birthday.</p><p>After the trauma she experienced with her first two pregnancies, Kardashian and West turned to surrogacy to see the healthy births of their children Psalm and Saint.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>North West: TikTok Icon</strong></h2><p>In November 2021, Kardashian and her older daughter released a joint TikTok account on Thanksgiving day, calling it @kimandnorth</p><p>The bio of the account reads: <strong>“Me and my bestie, Account managed by an adult.”</strong></p><p>&nbsp;As of December 2021, the account has over 3 million followers.</p><p>In their first video posted on the platform, the mother-daughter duo chronicled their at-home spa day, using products from Kylie Jenner’s Kylie Skin brand.</p><p>The video recieved over 10 million likes, with many fans loving&nbsp; North’s casual style of conversation.</p><p>Other videos posted throughout November and December include a Christmas decor tour, outfit videos, and a jazzy dance to Adele’s newest single, ‘Easy On Me.’</p><p>One video even exposed Santa Claus as nothing more than a decoration piece.&nbsp;</p><p>In an interview with <a href=#>Bari Weiss</a>, Kardashian was asked if North would follow in her mother’s social media footsteps, to which Kardashian replied:</p><p><strong>“Absolutely… I mean, North West is Kanye West’s daughter,” Kardashian West said. “Forget that, she’s his twin. So she will definitely do all of the above. But in my household, there are rules.”</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>North West’s Accidental Live</strong></h2><p>North West proved she was like any other 8-year-old when she stole her mother’s phone and went live on TikTok – without her mother’s permission.</p><p>In the <a href=#>video</a>, North West gave viewers a glimpse of life in Kim Kardashian’s <a href=#>business</a> empire, landing in hot water after running to her mother’s bedroom and announcing she had gone live.</p><p>Her mother was not too pleased, chastising her daughter by getting her to end the live, telling her,<strong> “no stop, you’re not allowed to!”</strong> before making sure North was actually streaming.&nbsp;</p><p>A quick-witted North hurriedly bid her followers adieu before ending the stream.</p><p>While many TikTok users laughed about the situation, some voiced their concerns about an 8-year-old having access to a platform as large as TikTok.</p><p>Many users said Kardashian should make sure North West stays off social media for a while to learn her lesson.</p><p>Her mother then revealed that nobody was more concerned for North’s online safety than Mason Disick, Kourtney’s eldest son.</p><p>Disick sent his aunt a series of concerned text messages after the live.</p><p>The eldest member of the Kardashian-Jenner clan of kids reached out to Kardashian to advise her about his cousin’s safety.</p><p>It is safe to assume Disick has had his fair share of lectures regarding inappropriate uses of social media, given he was the go-to source for gossip about the family in his Instagram days.</p><p>After spilling one too many family secrets, Disick’s parents Kourtney and Scott, shut his Instagram account down.</p><p>What they did not expect him to do was to turn to <a href=#>TikTok</a> to continue spearing information about them, his family, and Keeping Up With The Kardashians.</p><p>In a series of <a href=#>screenshots</a> posted to her story, Kardashian shared the conversation she had been having with her nephew.</p><p>The texts began with:</p><p><strong>“Hi I don’t wanna disrespect north but I don’t think she should do the lives unless someone is with her because people are always screen recording and she might tell information that isn’t correct and stuff like that, that she will regret,”&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Dicisk said he would accidentally reveal inappropriate information about his parents to his followers, hoping North would learn from her older cousin’s mistakes.</p><p><strong>“I did the exact same thing as she did,”</strong> he wrote.<strong> “I would do the lives and now I regret saying one of the things that I said.”</strong></p><p>Kardashian praised her nephew for his mature approach to the situation, and many of her followers were happy to see the younger Kardashian-Jenner kids supporting one another.</p><p><strong>“I appreciate you looking out Mason,” </strong>she replied. <strong>“And I agree. She felt bad and I don’t think she will do it again but it could be good if you talk to her about it.”</strong></p><p>Fans are happy to see North West thriving on social media after the news of her parents’ separation has been in the news since Kardashian first filed for divorce earlier this year.</p><p>According to Kardashian, West would often discuss his eldest child in various public stunts, which she felt was detrimental to their daughter.</p><p>In a fit of rage, West admitted to wanting to hurt North when his mental health would get out of hand, prompting Kardashian to file for divorce over the summer officially.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC0zrBkqKSUYra0ec2oqa2gXayytMCO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-get-sorush-pet-companion-genshin-impact.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to get Sorush pet companion in Genshin Impact">&larr;
