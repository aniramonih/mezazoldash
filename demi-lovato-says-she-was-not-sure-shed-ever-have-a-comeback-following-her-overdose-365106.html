After all, it almost killed her.</p><p>Furthermore, even after she thankfully survived, her life was still greatly affected to the point that she was convinced she would never return to the stage again.</p><p>During her interview on SiriusXM’s Radio Andy, Demi opened up about her scary experience following her successful return to the stage at the Grammy Awards.</p><p>While she definitely got a lot of praise for her emotional singing at the awards show, Demi admitted that she was not even confident she would be able to make a comeback in the first place.</p><p>About ‘Anyone,’ the song she performed, she explained to Andy Cohen that ‘I knew it represented that period in my life when everything hit the fan. I knew that it represented everything that I was going through, the vulnerability… I have never had a moment like this where I have sat down at a piano and sang my heart out. I thought that, if I ever come back from this… I was still in the hospital. If I ever come back from this… I want it to be at the GRAMMY Awards and I want it to be this song.’</p><p>Sure enough, she got exactly what she wanted as her first time on stage following the overdose.</p><p>The song was a ‘cry’ for help for the singer since she apparently recorded it only days before her relapse and overdosed.</p><p>That being said, it makes sense that people were touched by it since it was so personal and raw.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>As for her career following the incident, she admitted that ‘Yeah, absolutely [I thought I might not return to music]. It was a general [thought] though. We did not know what would happen. We didn’t know how healthy I would be when I left. It was a very scary time in my life, for sure.’</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeUmrqqecuorZqsn2LAosXSZqqhnV2srrR5zairZqulp7Juv8eem2adppq%2FbrTAr5xmmV2YvK6xwZqapGWWpLmtu9aipaBlmJq%2FbrvVnqmdp6OaenSClGpnb2c%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./gta-5-dirt-bike-spawn-cheat-pc-xbox-ps4.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dirt Bike spawn cheats for PC, Xbox, and PS4">&larr;
