May of last year in Roseville, California</p><p><span>The son of a wealthy extreme sports owner has been arrested for his father's murder, with police concluding that the motive was money.</span></p><p><span>Christopher Dale Northam, 44, was a budding sports mogul when he was found dead inside his extreme sports complex on May 30 of last year.</span></p><p><span>Police arrested his 25-year-old son, Christopher Jon Michael Northam, for premeditated murder after a long and exhaustive investigation.<br></span></p><p><span>They believe that the son was ‘lying in wait’ for his father at the skateboarding park in Roseville, California, before shooting him multiple times with a rifle.</span></p><p><span>The investigation took eight months and, in the end, police were able to conclude that the junior Northam, who goes by Chris, was in the complex at the same time as his father using Wi-fi and cell phone records.<br></span></p><p><span>The elder Mr Northam was the owner of Skim X, a company that specialized in the sport of skim boarding where participants glide over water while standing on a very thin, short surfboard.</span></p><p><span>While police have concluded that the murder was financially motivated, it is unclear how much the son stood to make off of his father’s death, especially since the son was already an officer in the company.<br></span></p><p><span>Before concluding that Chris was responsible for his father’s death, detectives had to rule out a bevy of disgruntled investors, which also contributed to the length of the investigation.<br></span></p><p><span>'We want the people so bad,' Mr Northam's father Michael told a local news station in September- when police still hadn't arrested anyone in connection to the murder four months after the fact.</span></p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=#
