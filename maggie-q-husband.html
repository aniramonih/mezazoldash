Starting her professional career in Hong Kong, she has starred in numerous films and series. Born and raised in Hawaii, Maggie has shown her exemplary acting skills in every project she starred in.</p><p>With the fame that she has achieved in her professional career, Maggie has been in the limelight for a long time. As a result, many must be curious to discover some facts about her, especially her love life. Hence, in this article, let’s know who Maggie Q’s husband is and more information about her romantic life.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Broke_Off_The_Engagement_With_Dylan_McDermott></span>Broke Off The Engagement With Dylan McDermott<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Maggie Q and <strong>Dylan McDermott</strong> were once one of the favorite couples of Hollywood. The former pair met while filming the CBS series Stalker. US Magazine confirmed their relationship in October 2014, after the show premiered. They were seen enjoying a romantic evening in Santa Barbara.</p><p>In January 2015, the former duo got engaged <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">while spending time</a> in Hawaii. However, no wedding date was set at that time. Nevertheless, the years that followed were filled with happiness and bliss, and the ex-couple never stopped gushing about one another publicly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Dylan-McDermott-and-Maggie-Q-relationship.jpg><p>Maggie Q’s then-boyfriend often talked about her in interviews. In one such instance, he described her as an incredible person. Despite being immensely in love, the duo did not tie the knot immediately. Similarly, she also described her then husband-to-be as someone with an extraordinary heart. In March 2015, the actress revealed that they were waiting to find a perfect date for their special day. Furthermore, their busy careers and heavy workloads were other factors too.</p><p>Unfortunately, Maggie and Dylan never got their fairy tale wedding as <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">they split in</a> 2019 after four years of being engaged. Though they have never spoken publicly about their split, it must have been difficult for the former lovebirds.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Admitted_About_Not_Being_Taken_Out_On_A_Date></span>Admitted About Not Being Taken Out On A Date<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As mentioned earlier, despite being in the limelight, Maggie has remained much more low-key than expected. However, in August 2021, she gave an exclusive sneak peek at her love life in an episode of the Tamron Hall Show. She admitted to having a very silly rule about dating only vegan people.</p><p>The actress revealed that she now understands she cannot expect people to follow her beliefs when they meet her. She used to be someone who forced her beliefs on them and expected people to live the way that she did. But, she later realized that a gentler approach worked far better.</p><p>The show host, <strong>Tamron Hall,</strong> asked her what would happen if her first date was at a burger spot. To which Q replied that, fortunately, every burger joint’s got an option. She further added that she never really dated and was never taken out on a date. <i>The Protege </i>star admitted that she was bad and shy about that kind of thing.</p><p>Hall further jokingly asked her to come to the studio after the movie and read all the date requests which would come after her statement.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Learn More About Steve Toussaint’s Love Life</a></strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Maggie_Qs_Past_Relationships></span>Maggie Q’s Past Relationships<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Despite having a prosperous professional career, Maggie does not seem to have the same type of luck in the dating department. She has been through several failed relationships in the past, so she must be waiting for Mr. Right for a long-lasting relationship.</p><p>Maggie once dated Hong Kong-based American actor, director, and producer <strong>Daniel Wu</strong>. Since the former pair come from the same professional background, they must have met during the course of work. Then, in 2005, she was in a relationship with <strong>Daniel Henney</strong>. Then, two years later, she was reportedly dating <strong>Justin Long</strong>.</p><p>Likewise, as per&nbsp;Who’s Dated Who,&nbsp;The Protege actress was in a relationship with <strong>Brett Ratner</strong> from 2008 to 2010. Other than that, as mentioned earlier, she has also been engaged once.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Maggie_Qs_Husband></span>Who Is Maggie Q’s Husband?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Since breaking up with McDermott, Q has remained lowkey about her love life. As a result, her present relationship status remains a mystery. While Maggie Q’s ex-boyfriend, Dylan, has already found love with Brazilian model <strong>Hettielly Beck</strong>, it is unknown whether the actress is seeing someone.</p><p>Hence, there’s not much information about Maggie Q’s boyfriend at the moment. She must be focusing on her career. Likewise, she does not have any kids, but she is a dog mom to many fur babies, with whom she enjoys adequate time.</p><p>All in all, the actress seems to be happy and content with her little family of fur babies, whom she often features on her social media. As an animal activist, she actively speaks for animal rights.</p><p>Hopefully, we will get to learn more about Maggie’s love life in the coming days. Having been through several failed relationships, we hope she finds her long-term bond soon.</p><p><strong>For<span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;More Updates On&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Celebrity Babies</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Feuds</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Their Riches</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Siblings</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, And&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Entertainment</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, Keep In Touch With&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>eCelebrityMirror.</span></strong></a></p><strong>For More Updates on <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Articles</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Celebrity Babies</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Celebrity Feuds</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Celebrity Siblings</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Entertainment</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Richest Celebrities</a>, Keep In Touch With <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>eCelebritymirror.</a></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidk5q5pq7RoquypZmnv7C%2BjZympmeVo8GmvtOaoKellaPBcLnAoJ6inV2meqnB0puYp5xf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./mayen-mehta-wikipedia-bio-of-interceptor-cast-his-ethnicity-and-parents-origin.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Mayen Mehta?
