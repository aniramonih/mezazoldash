He has released 13 studio albums and won two Grammy Awards for his collaborations with other artists. He is also a member of the Grand Ole Opry since 1992.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Happened to Travis Tritt in 2022?</h2><p>In May 2022, a rumor spread on social media that Travis Tritt had died in a car accident in South Carolina. The rumor was based on a false report that claimed that Tritt was involved in a fatal crash with a drunk driver who was going the wrong way on a highway. The report also claimed that two other people were killed and one was injured in the accident.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How Did Travis Tritt Respond to the Death Hoax?</h2><p>Travis Tritt quickly debunked the death hoax on his Twitter account, where he posted a video of himself alive and well. He said that he was “shocked and saddened” by the false news and that he was “praying for the families of those who lost their lives”. He also thanked his fans for their support and love.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why Did the Death Hoax Start?</h2><p>The death hoax was likely inspired by a real incident that happened in 2019, when Travis Tritt was involved in a non-fatal car crash in South Carolina. In that case, Tritt’s tour bus was sideswiped by a vehicle that had collided with another car driven by a drunk driver who was going the wrong way on the highway. Two people died and one was injured in that crash, but Tritt and his crew were not harmed. Tritt shared his experience and his condolences on social media at the time.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Travis Tritt Doing Now?</h2><p>Travis Tritt is still active in the music industry and has released his latest album, Set in Stone, in 2021. The album features 11 new songs written or co-written by Tritt and produced by Dave Cobb. The album received positive reviews from critics and fans and debuted at number 10 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart. Tritt is also touring across the country to promote his album and perform his classic hits.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7JfmbaledOrmK%2Bho2LBs7XTrWSpmaOoeqLDwLJka2hiZ3q1tMRmq6utpJ16o7HHoqWdZaSdsm6wxJqroWWYpK65eZFo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./does-desmond-bane-have-short-arms-6-4-wingspan-despite-a-decent-height.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Does Desmond Bane Have Short Arms? 6 4 Wingspan Despite A Decent Height">&larr;
