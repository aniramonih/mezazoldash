The singer first clued fans in on the development in December 2022 with the lyrics of two of her songs.</strong></p><p>By 2023, she granted an interview where she confirmed what was in her song and revealed that it was not industry pressure that made her decide to get work done on her butt. Her forthrightness has generated diverse opinions, and all are sampled below. We also examine the before and after pictures of the songstress.</p><h2><strong>SZA Before Surgery</strong></h2><p>SZA started pursuing a music career as a 22-year-old in 2011. She steadily built a reputation for herself and finally got her breakthrough in 2016. That year, she worked with artists such as Beyoncé and Rihanna, and the next year, she released her smash hit debut album titled Ctrl.</p><p>It had several hit singles and charted high. Time Magazine also declared it to be the album of the year, and the singer performed at several concerts, ceremonies, etc. At that time, SZA had not gotten any surgery. She had a tall slim figure, and her butt was quite moderate in size. In fact, she herself called it small, singing about having no booty in her 2017 track Garden Like It Like Dat. Some fans, however, disagreed with her, pointing out that she was “thick”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/10/SZA.jpg><h2><strong>SZA After Surgery</strong></h2><p>Following the success of her debut album, SZA has grown to become a famous figure in Hollywood. She has headlined sold-out tours and concerts. She has also scooped up numerous awards for her songs. The New Jersey native is simply a force to be reckoned with, and every aspect of her life is frequently covered by the media.</p><p>The paparazzi, of course, take numerous pictures of her. She also posts some of her photos online. A look at recent pictures of SZA shows that she has a much curvier figure with a noticeably defined butt. Of course, it is quite easy to attribute her hourglass figure to dieting and working out, but it is not easy to do the same for her butt. Of course, some exercises are said to help with improving one’s butt, but SZA’s is not something that crystalized over time but happened overnight.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>SZA describes her sophomore album:</p><p>“I have no idea what it sounds like to anybody else. It’s weird that I can’t put my finger on it. It’s a little bit of everything. It’s a little aggressive. Some parts are incredibly soft. Some of them are ballads. It’s all over the place.“ <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/MH43DOzart</a></p><p>— Pop Crave (@PopCrave) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">October 3, 2022</a></p><p>Most celebrities remain vague when asked if they have made any enhancements to their body. They rarely come out and claim it, but SZA is a different kettle of fish. Firstly, in December 2022, she released her second studio album, SOS, and used two of the tracks to allude to her physical transformation. In the titular track, SZA declared that her ass wasn’t natural though it might look so singing; So classic, that ass so fat, it look natural, it’s not”</p><p>On another track titled Conceited, SZA talked about having work done on her body. Her exact words were “I don’t like nobody, I don’t feel guilty about it. I just got my body done, ain’t got no guilt about it. I just heard your opinion, I could’ve did without it”. This clued fans in on the fact that SZA had undergone plastic surgery, specifically a Brazilian Butt Lift, BBL, and she confirmed it during an interview with Elle Magazine in March 2023.</p><p>SZA stated that her decision to get plastic surgery was not borne out of <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">industry pressure</a> but was rather her own personal choice. According to the singer, she had always wanted to have a fat ass with less gym time, and that ambition was brought into sharp focus whenever she looked at herself in the mirror. She, therefore, decided to fulfill her desires.</p><p>The singer further likened her butt to a purse, saying, “I treat my butt like a purse; it’s just there to enhance whatever else,” she tells the outlet. “And that’s why I paid for it, because it works all by itself.”</p><p>SZA’s honesty triggered a wave of mostly positive reactions online. People praised her for her honesty. However, some pointed out that she shouldn’t have to explain her private choices to anybody.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZMC7rYybmaVlp52utXnSoZxmpJ%2BkuLR5y6KinmWSmrOwvsRmmKecXZaztbHRZqquqpeav7p7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kevin-mitnick.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Convicted Hacker Kevin Mitnick?
