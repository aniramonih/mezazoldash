He again went through the greatest trauma when his 24-years-old son named&nbsp;Jose Emiliano Aguilar was arrested for the Smuggling Charges on March 14, 2017.</p><p>He was allegedly smuggling four Chinese men into the United States by hiding them in the trunk of his car. According to the insiders and other resources, his son got into many illegal charges for crossing into the United States as he was caught red-handed at the San Ysidro Port of Entry in San Diego.</p><p>He was also accompanied by female passengers. The officers of U.S. Custom and Border Protection (CBP) searched his car, Chrysler 200 with a K-9 unit and found four Chinese citizens with non-official documents to enter the United States.</p><p>And as a part of the investigation, the car was seized. Those days were very heavy for his whole family when they were facing such a horrible problem of being kidnapped.</p><p>And in one of the interviews, Officers opened up that Chinese men are ready to pay the amount between $3000 and $60,000 for the successful smuggling into the United States.</p><p>As we recently got the news that Jose was realized after he paid a $15,000 bond and was ordered to live with his mother. But he is now not allowed to leave Southern California and was sent for counseling.</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Jose revealed something about the incident</a>:</p><p>“We understand the interest in our client Jose Aguilar because of his father’s musical career. However, this case has nothing to do with Pepe Aguilar. Jose Aguilar is young man who will address this matter in court, and not in the press. We understand that Pepe Aguilar will provide a statement shortly. In the meantime, we ask that you respect the family’s privacy.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Short_Bio_on_Pepe_Aguilar></span><span>Short Bio on Pepe Aguilar</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Pepe is a Mexican-American singer-songwriter and actor.
