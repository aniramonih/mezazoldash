The actor who played this character, Mason Dye, caught the eye of the audience, not just because of his versatile acting, but also for his good looks – at least according to female fans of the series.</p><p>One way or another, people <a rel=nofollow href=#>wanted to know more</a> about his life, his career beginnings, and his upcoming projects. If you are one of those, keep on reading.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thebiography.org///thebiography.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/rs_1024x759-140224140654-1024.Wyatt-Nash-Mason-Dye.ms_.022414_copy.jpg><h2><span id=Early_life_family_and_education>Early life, family, and education</span></h2><p>Born Mason Andrew Dye on 15 July 1994, his zodiac sign is Cancer, and he hails from Shawnee, Oklahoma USA, thus his nationality is American; his ethnicity is of mixed English, Scottish and Irish descent.</p><p>There is nothing known about his parents since he respects their wish to stay away from the media’s attention, however, it’s known that he has a brother, Preston, and a sister Taylor, known as a member of <a rel=nofollow href=#>the country duo</a> called Maddie & Tae.</p><p>When it comes to his educational background, upon matriculating from high school in 2012, Mason &nbsp;enrolled at Tennessee College of Applied Technology, from which he graduated with a BS degree in 2016.</p><h2><span id=Acting_career>Acting career</span></h2><p>Mason made his acting debut as Brandon in the 2013 series “Secret Diary of an American Cheerleader” – although seen in less than 10 episodes, his charisma and sensational acting brought him his first movie role later that year, when he was cast to play Marc in “Adventures of Bailey: A Night in Cowtown”, a family comedy, also starring Frank Mosley, Mark Hanson and Trey Bumpass.</p><p>In the following year, <a rel=nofollow href=#>Mason was seen</a> as Christopher in the TV mini-series “The Dollanganger Saga”, based on the novel “Flowers in the Attic” by Virginia C. Andrews. The series followed the twisted story of four children who were cruelly treated by their wealthy grandmother after their father died suddenly, and her mother convinced them to stay hidden in the attic of their grandmother’s house so that she could reclaim the family fortune. However, the children’s mother’s visits begin to wane, and they are now in the hands of their ruthless grandmother.</p><p lang=fr dir=ltr><a rel=nofollow href=#>#PHOTO</a> de Mason dans l'épisode 4×03 de <a rel=nofollow href=#>#TeenWolf</a> – Muted #5 <a rel=nofollow href=#>pic.twitter.com/QdDSwU3575</a></p><p>— Mason Dye France (@MasonDyeFrance) <a rel=nofollow href=#>July 9, 2014</a></p><p>Later in 2014, Mason was seen as Tyler in an episode of the series “Review”, followed by his role as Garrett in four episodes of the series “Teen Wolf”, starring Tyler Posey, Dylan O’Brien and Holland Roden, which had 41 award nominations and won 23.</p><p>In 2015, Mason returned to the big screen as Victor in the thriller “My Stepdaughter”, followed later that year by his role as Damon in the series “Finding Carter”.</p><p>Mason was next cast to play Tyler Evans in the 2016 drama “Natural Selection”, which was his first lead role. He starred opposite Ryan Munzert and Anthony Michael Hall, and the movie followed the story of a shy high school boy who was bullied by everyone in his class except by one who has an infectious, dark outlook.</p><p>Later that year, Mason made a guest appearance in an episode of the series “Major Crimes”, followed by his role as Josh Jackson in the movie “Vanished”, in which he starred opposite Amber Frank and Dylan Sprayberry.</p><p>Mason was seen in two TV movies, entitled “Stalker’s Pray” and “Truth or Dare” In 2017, while in 2018, he was cast to play Matt in the thriller “Her Son’s Secret”.</p><p>In the following year, he played Tom Galligan in in eight episodes of the series “Bosch”, this crime drama that follows a homicide detective who works on solving the murder of a 13-year-old boy while on trial for the murder of a serial killer. It had 14 award nominations, including one for Primetime Emmy, and won nine.</p><p>Next, Mason was seen as Rick Kentwood in an episode of the series “The Goldbergs” also in 2019.</p><p>In 2022, came his most notable television series role to date, as Jason Carver in “Stranger Things” – Mason stated that playing this role was quite challenging for him, because in real life he’s never raised his voice to anyone, but this character is a bully.</p><h2><span id=Love_life_and_girlfriend>Love life and girlfriend</span></h2><p>Mason has been the subject of various rumors, mostly concerning his sexual orientation, saying that he might be gay or bisexual. However, the truth is that he’s straight, although as he said, he supports the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) community.</p><p>Some rumors were saying that he is in a secret relationship with one of his female co-stars from “Stranger Things”, which also proved false. His girlfriend is non-celebrity Carmen Joiner, <a rel=nofollow href=#>whose photos Mason often</a> shares on his social media accounts.</p><p>As of January 2023, Mason is in a relationship, he hasn’t been married or been engaged, and doesn’t have children.</p><h2><span id=Hobbies_and_other_interests>Hobbies and other interests</span></h2><p>Like many young celebrities, Mason is active on his social media accounts; his Instagram has been followed by nearly 550,000 people – the number of his followers grew rapidly after his appearance in “Stranger Things”.</p><p>Mason has a Twitter account, established in 2015, but it seems that he doesn’t use this social media platform since his last post is from November 2015. He has a TikTok account too, however, he hasn’t posted any videos. Fun fact: the videos <a rel=nofollow href=#>related to his name</a> have gained nearly 80 million likes on TikTok.</p><p>In his spare time, Mason likes to hang out with his friends and girlfriend.</p><p>He likes to travel, and his favorite travel destination is Mexico.</p><p>Mason is a big fan of movies – his idols are actors Jack Nicholson and Nicholas Cage.</p><h2><span id=Age_appearance_and_net_worth>Age, appearance, and net worth</span></h2><p>Mason is 28 years old, although many people assume that he is younger – perhaps his blonde hair, piercing blue eyes, and light skin contribute to that opinion. When it comes to his height, Mason is 5ft 7ins (1.73m) tall, and weighs around 155lbs (70kgs).</p><p>If you have wondered how rich this young actor is, with nearly 20 acting credits to his name thanks to his talent, Mason has earned a decent amount of money. According to sources, as of early 2023, his net worth has been estimated at over $500,000.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqvqrvGq5ipoKljvLOzjpqZqK2kYrqiv86nZJ2xlWLAtb7Ap56eql2ptaq6xqxkmp%2BVYrSqvsufqaKdnpl6r7HTZq6oqqSdfA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./albie-manzo-net-worth-bio-age-height-jamie-rose-and-the-real-housewives-of-new-jersey.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Albie Manzo Net Worth: Bio, Age, Height, Jamie Rose, and The Real Housewives of New Jersey">&larr;
