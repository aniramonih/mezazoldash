I JUST WISH I'D FORCED THEM APART</p><p>THE love between Paula Yates and Michael Hutchence set both on a path to destruction. Video director NICK EGAN, above, was Michael's best friend and today he reveals exclusively to the Sunday Mirror the truth about their doomed lifestyle of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll.IHAVE no doubts that Paula and Michael loved each other but there are some kinds of love which just aren't healthy.</p><p>There is a love so passionate and obsessive, it is destructive. And the proof of that is in what's happened to them both.</p><p>I was there the night they got together. I just wish now that I could have forced the two of them apart.</p><p>At the the time Paula didn't drink or take drugs and I only found out later about Michael's heroin habit. Their relationship was a strong one, yet Michael couldn't resist other women - and had other lovers in the months before his death.</p><p>It was spring 1995 when Michael and Paula - who I had known since 1977 when she was with Bob Geldof - fell for each other. Michael had just done that famous Big Breakfast interview on the bed with her. I was working with Duran Duran on their video for White Lines.</p><p>A crowd of us went to the Hilton Hotel hotel and got wasted before moving on to Simon Le Bon's house in South London. Michael was still with Helena Christensen, the supermodel, who stayed behind at the Hilton.</p><p>We were all sitting together in Simon's living room when Michael said to me: "Paula and I are going upstairs now." We knew there was something going on. There was a kind of electricity between them.</p><p>The next day I asked him: "Michael what are you doing? What about Helena?" and he replied: "We didn't have sex you know." They were both on ecstasy, in a bedroom, and he expected me to believe they didn't have sex?</p><p>Paula was immediately hooked on Michael. She was mad about him. When Helena found out Michael bought her a $20,000 antique necklace, to say: "I'm sorry." I told him that was a confession - that the bigger the gift, the bigger the lie.</p><p>People used to think I was crazy to like Paula - there was certainly a side to her that was ditzy and over-the-top flirtatious. But another side was incredibly intelligent, caring and loving.</p><p>I spent a three-week holiday with Michael and Paula in the South of France just before Tiger was born. I'd recently broken up with the mother of my son, Paula had split up with Bob, and Michael had just finished with Helena.</p><p>Even on holiday, Paula always looked immaculate - she was the eternal sex bomb. She was not a woman you ever saw in sweatpants.</p><p>The nurturing Paula was very tender to my son Roman, Michael's godchild. She wanted to have a baby and every morning I would carry Roman, who was 15 months old, into Michael and Paula's bedroom and the three of them would have breakfast together.</p><p>That was a very important time for them both and it was the happiest I ever saw them. In fact she later said that Roman had inspired Michael to have a child.</p><p>All three of Paula's children by Bob were there - Fifi, Pixie and Peaches - and it was clear they had inherited her tenderness.</p><p>But back in London, Paula and Michael seemed permanently paranoid. They built a huge wall at their place in Clapham because they felt they were in enemy territory.</p><p>Compared to Paula, Michael's other girlfriends ruined his rock and roll image. In the early days Kylie Minogue was too goody-two-shoes and Helena was in the awful fashion crowd.</p><p>Michael was two people - he was like Paula in that respect. He was an incredibly loving father, but he was also a wild rock and roller. On one of his wildest most outrageous nights before he met Paula we were drinking in a late night bar in King's Cross.</p><p>A woman who looked like Siouxsie from the Banshees on a bad night started chatting to Michael. It was obvious she was a prostitute. He was fascinated by women like her and took her back to his hotel. I said to him, "You have Helena Christiansen at home - why risk it all for HER?"</p><p>Among a few things I didn't know about Michael was that he was on heroin. That came from hanging out in Los Angeles - with the druggie celebrity set who frequented the Viper Room, where River Phoenix died.</p><p>WHILE in LA he started dating an American woman called Erin. It was towards the end of Michael's life and Paula had flown from London with their daughter Tiger Lily.</p><p>But on Paula's first night in LA he didn't want to stay in the hotel with her - even though she'd travelled all that way to be with him.</p><p>He told Paula he was going out with me, but he was in fact seeing Erin. I had found out about Erin when I walked in to Michael's hotel room in San Francisco. She was in his bed. It made it worse that he was on the phone to Paula at the time. Erin was seeing Michael for a few months before he died. Her father was a political aide and she seemed a very nice girl.</p><p>She wasn't the only one. He had already had a fling with a model called Caroline Rorich, who I'd used in a Cornetto commercial. He got away with it because we were in South Africa, then she sold her story and he panicked. He didn't see her after that.</p><p>There was even another girl he had been seeing at the end. She was young and seemed very naive, fragile and quiet, not Michael's normal type at all. But she was also a heroin addict and rumoured to be a stripper.</p><p>After Michael's death she came to see me, I think she wanted endorsement from Michael's trusted friend. It was clear they had known each other for a long time and he had been fond of her.</p><p>Paula must have sensed something was going on. And it was messing her up. If I had to put a bet on someone dying it was Paula in LA. She was on anti-depressants and there was a point when security at the hotel where she was staying had to break into her room because Tiger was crying and Paula had passed out.</p><p>When I first knew Paula she didn't drink or take drugs. But when she got to LA she would knock back three pina coladas in a row. She just wanted to get loaded.</p><p>Michael would do an eclectic mix of drugs - and he drank. He was always very experimental with sex and substances. Paula by this time was emotionally over the top and unable to cope.</p><p>One day she went out to get bagels and she was so out of it that she came back with 30. When Michael asked her why, she said: "I've got some for Nick and Ann (my wife)." Michael told her we weren't there, we were at home.</p><p>It was a horrible period. Paula had an awful fight with Michael's mother Patricia during a family dinner. Patricia saw the state of her and shouted: "Pull yourself together." I sensed there was also a distaste from Michael's sister Tina.</p><p>It was three weeks before he died and he just wasn't the same old Michael. He was sad. He was vacant. It was all he could do to take the pressure of what was going on. He was also beside himself over the way public opinion was against Paula. Bob Geldof's power in the media was important and Paula couldn't get a job when she was sacked from the Big Breakfast.</p><p>People saw Geldof as St Bob, and Michael and Paula as evil. Michael told me that he was going marry Paula, but I know he was pondering it rather than taking action. I think partly it was to help with custody of the children.</p><p>HIS one shred of hope was getting Paula and the children to Australia so Paula could get a job and they could start a new life.</p><p>But Paula wouldn't leave England without her children. Ultimately the drugs and the custody battles destroyed Michael and Paula. I can categorically say that Michael loved Paula very much. He might have had other women, but he wanted to take care of her. As well as being very loving Paula was an obsessive person, she loved Michael - I mean unbelievably loved him.</p><p>In LA she was trying to have another baby, she carried her pregnancy kit everywhere with her. She was taking fertility drugs - I think she would even have liked to have quintuplets. It was all getting too much for Michael.</p><p>Paula was on a self-destruct course. There was the drink and this thing about heroin. She seemed to have a death wish. Paula was a British Marilyn Monroe, though much smarter. She was never taken seriously, always seen as the dizzy blonde on the verge of collapse.</p><p>She liked her ecstasy, but she'd say to Michael: "We'll do that once a month. We'll have fun, and then we'll leave it for a bit."</p><p>Maybe towards the end she might have done more than Michael to try and outdo him. And then after he died, I'm sure she did it because she just couldn't live without him.</p><p>-Nick Egan was talking to JANE JOHNSON</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3TmqOorZ6csm%2BvzqZmraCimq6le5BpaW9xYGqBbrzArqOaZamWwaa%2FjKagnKCRmrlutNStmqGdnpiybq3NnWSbp5JitKa4w6id</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./prince-harry-meghan-markle-kiss-cam-lakers-game.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Appear on the Kiss Cam at Lakers Game">&larr;
