His mother is an American gun rights activist, businesswoman, and politician. She serves as a U.S. representative for Colorado’s third congressional district and is also a member of the Republican Party.</strong></p><p>The politician has made a mark in several sectors of the economy and is known for airing her views. Laura has become a force to be reckoned with, thus thrusting Kaydon Boebert into the limelight.</p><h3><b>Summary of <strong>Kaydon Boebert</strong>’s Bio&nbsp;</b></h3><ul><li><b>Full name: </b>Kaydon Boebert</li><li><b>Gender:</b> Male</li><li><b>Date of birth:</b> July 2009</li><li><b><strong>Kaydon Boebert</strong>’s Age:</b> 14 year old</li><li><b>Ethnicity: </b>White</li><li><b>Nationality: </b>American</li><li><b>Zodiac Sign: </b>Cancer/ Leo</li><li><b>Sexual Orientation: </b>Straight</li><li><b>Religion: </b>Christianity</li><li><b>Marital Status: </b>Single</li><li><b><strong>Kaydon Boebert</strong>’s Parents: </b>Lauren Boebert and Jayson Boebert</li><li><b>Siblings: </b>Finn Boebert, Sam Boebert, and Jack Boebert</li><li><b>Famous for: </b>Being the third child and son of Laura Boebert and Jayson Boebert</li></ul><h2><strong>How Old Is Kaydon Boebert?</strong></h2><p>Kaydon Boebert is 14 years old. He was born in July 2009 in the United States of America. The son of Lauren Boebert and Jayson Boebert,&nbsp;Kaydon inherited white roots from his mother, while his father’s root have been shielded from the public. Since his exact date of birth is not disclosed, his zodiac sign falls between Cancer and Leo.</p><p>The politician’s son was born in a van because his mother couldn’t make it to the hospital at the time of labor. Lauren started having labor contractions at about one o’clock at midnight in their home and her husband used their pickup van to drive her to the hospital. However, they did not get to the hospital before her water broke, with the baby’s head already making its way out.</p><p>Lauren revealed that she was scared but couldn’t control herself because her body kept pushing. She caught her baby, put him on her chest, and told her husband to keep moving. Meanwhile, they went through with the delivery of their son in the front seat of their van. She revealed that by the time they got to the hospital and made their way to the emergency room, they were all messed up.</p><p>Though he is already in the spotlight, Kaydon Boebert’s life appears to be shielded from the public because of his mother’s political position, which is why little is known about him. He attends a private school in Glenwood Springs, though the name of the school and level of education have been withheld. Based on what is presumed to be his age, he should be at the basic level of his education. Also, he does not have a career that is known to the public yet and is fully focused on his education.</p><h2><strong>His Mother’s Political Position Brought Him To The Limelight</strong></h2><p>Kaydon Boebert’s mother, Lauren Boebert, was born on December 19, 1986, in Altamonte Springs, Florida. At the age of 12, she relocated to Colorado with her parents. She is an American businesswoman, gun rights activist, and politician. She is a member of the Republican Party and serves as a U.S. representative for Colorado’s third congressional district.</p><p>Lauren dropped out of high school to start working and served in a few companies before pursuing her political career. She started her career as an assistant manager at McDonald’s in Rifle. She also worked at a natural gas drilling company and by 2013, she established a restaurant in Rifle with her husband, Jayson, known as Shooters Grill.</p><p>After the 2016 presidential elections in America, she kicked off her political career. She became elected as a Republican after she won the 2021 election. Lauren has since expressed her support for gun rights even though it does not go in line with the basic laws of gun and firearm control in the country. She is also notable for lending her voice to other sectors like healthcare, education, religion, foreign policy, LGBT, and others.</p><h3><strong>Kaydon Boebert’s Father Runs Their Gun-Themed Restaurant</strong></h3><p>Kaydon Boebert’s father, Jayson Boebert, was born in 1980, but his month and date of birth have been unclear. He graduated from the College of Southern Nevada, a public community college in Clark County, Nevada.</p><p>He established and runs their restaurant, Shooters Grill, together with his wife. Prior to establishing the restaurant, he worked as a roughneck for Nabors Drilling. He also ran Boebert Consulting LLC for seven years before he worked as a well-site supervisor for Chesapeake Energy, an American exploration and production company that deals with oil and gas.</p><h3><strong>Lauren and Jayson Boebert Have Been Married For 18 Years</strong></h3><p>Kaydon Boebert’s parents met after his father relocated to Colorado from Las Vegas, Nevada. At that time, Lauren had dropped out of high school and was working with a natural gas drilling company. They began dating and after some time, they decided to make things official.</p><p>In June 2005, they exchanged their marital vows, though the kind of ceremony that they had has never been disclosed. Also, the date of their wedding has not been made public. They have been married for 18 years and have faced the storms together as well as accomplished a lot as a team. Lauren and her husband usually flood their social media with their loved-up pictures accompanied by heartfelt messages in June every year to celebrate their wedding anniversary.</p><h2><strong>Kaydon Boebert Has Three Siblings</strong></h2><p>Kaydon Boebert is not the only child born to his parents. He has two older brothers and a younger brother while he maintains the position of the third child. Just like him, his brothers, Finn, Sam, and Jack, have also been shielded from the public as little is known about them.</p><p>Their exact date of birth is not known, as their month, date, and year of birth have been kept away from the public. Just like Kaydon, Finn, and Sam should be in their early teens while Jack is still a child. Their educational levels, the school they attend, and its location have been kept away from the public. However, according to an online source, they attend a private school in Glenwood Springs.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunDDx6hkoqtdoK66sM6nZJunlZeys8CMo5iyq5%2BjeqK6w2ajmq2imrturs6emZ6qpKh6tLvNaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-keisha-chambers-justin-chambers-wife.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Keisha Chambers, Justin Chambers' Wife?">&larr;
