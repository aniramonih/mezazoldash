In 2010 Jaxn started a YouTube channel where he gave out his advice on love relationships and let women know what they should expect from a real man.&nbsp;</p><p>Jaxn has amassed 1.3 million Instagram followers, 740 thousand <a href=#>YouTube subscribers</a>, and 63 thousand Twitter followers, bringing his net worth to around $1.5 million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Tragic Reality</h2><p>For Derrick Jaxn’s wife and thousands of relationship expert fans, reality and the ugly side of human nature came to light in 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>The first bombshell fell was from social media influencer, Candice De Medeiros. The influencer has made a name for herself online with inspiring and uplifting quotes, as well as handing out relationship advice of her own. Starting to see a pattern with all these influencers and their “<strong>advice</strong>.”</p><p>Medeiros made the affair public when she made an appearance on Tasha K’s vlog. Not kid-friendly btw. The scorned influencer, who is said to have known Jaxn for several years, claimed that Jaxn had brought her to his and his wife’s Atlanta home to spend time together. She could also produce receipts showing thousands of dollars that the cheating Jaxn had spent on her.</p><p>Soon after these allegations, a second woman came forward on the Tasha K vlog claiming that she met the relationship guru through Instagram. She claims the pair spent several months together before Jaxn told her he had worked things out with his wife.</p><p>And yet another woman, a 33-year-old Atlanta surgeon, came forward as well, claiming to have hooked up with Jaxn. The doctor claims she was approached by Jaxn in an Atlanta mall and was under the impression Derrick Jaxn’s wife was living out of state and that the pair were separated.</p><p>Before getting married, Derrick Jaxn and Da’Naia welcomed their first daughter into the world in 2016.&nbsp;</p><p>The pair would eventually marry in 2018 and welcome another daughter into their family soon after. Since the beginning, Derrick Jaxn’s wife has stood by her husband and helped him grow as a YouTuber, relationship expert, author, and highly <a href=#>successful entrepreneur</a>.</p><p>Thousands of people had put their trust into Jaxn, clinging to his every word, seeking his “<strong>expert</strong>” guidance to fix their relationship woes. But, much like the real world we live in, nothing online and in social media is ever fully what it seems.</p><p>Jackson. After they reconciled, the couple started a family together and has made it a priority to share their relationship online. Jaxn has written several relationship advice books and posts videos encouraging men to step up and treat women right.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Derrick Jaxn’s Wife Forgives Her Husband</h2><p>Most know that Derrick Jaxn’s wife, Da’Naia, is back with her husband and claims to have forgiven him. Many may not know that she did leave her cheating husband and filed for divorce, and Da’Naia spent much of 2020 away from her husband to move on with her life without him.&nbsp;</p><p>A few months after filing for divorce, however, Jaxn’s wife would have a change of heart.</p><p>Da’Naia was done entirely with her cheating husband until she says she saw significant changes in his behavior and personality. Derrick Jaxn’s wife had this to say in the now-deleted YouTube video the couple released.</p><p>“<strong>I didn’t hesitate or waste time to do so. And I stayed gone, no matter how many times he came, I stayed gone and stayed firm in my decision, and I did not come back until I saw a shift and change in his mentality and how he carried himself and how he presented himself in conversations that we were able to have that we were never able to have in 12 years of knowing each other.”</strong></p><p><strong>“So today, where I’m at, it’s at peace and by his side, and I have no hesitation or hurt or shame about that, and it’s only because of the grace of God and the mercy of God.</strong></p><p><strong>“And we have already turned a new chapter in this story, and we are continuing to move forward, and we are just now sharing this with you, and I forgave him, and most importantly, God has forgiven him and the others as well.”</strong></p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCwxKupopubYreixM1o</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./franco-escamilla-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is Franco Escamilla Net Worth 2024: Performances and Collaborations">&larr;
