She was a member of the team "Women of Faith" on the second season of The American Bible Challenge on GSN.</p><p>In 2005, Walsh partnered with <a href=#>Tommy Nelson</a> publishers to create a line of children's books and DVDs called Gigi, God's Little Princess .</p><p>Ideological differences with <a href=#>Pat Robertson</a> and general feelings of depression brought Walsh to re-examine her life's direction. After leaving Pat Robertson's enterprises in 1992 she sought therapy for her depression, eventually returning to college at Fuller Theological Seminary in California to take on doctoral studies in theology. <a href=#>Pat Robertson</a> explained her departure from CBN as the result of a "nervous breakdown" brought on by the tremendous demands of her work with CBN. He asked his viewers to keep her in their prayers and ask God to give her the strength to continue doing His work.</p><p>Over the course of the latter 1990s, Walsh's work has concerned women's issues within the church and the unique relationship of the contemporary woman with God. She has written over seventeen books including Honestly, Living Fearlessly, and Life is Tough, but God is Faithful. She has also written several books for children recently. She also has continued her musical career as a songwriter and singer and has recorded several albums of new Christian music and traditional hymns arranged to a Celtic sound.</p><p>Born in Ayr, Scotland, Walsh began her career as a contemporary Christian singer after finishing college with studies in theology from London Bible College (now London School of Theology) in 1979 and music from the London Academy of Operatic Art. Walsh worked as an evangelist with the British chapter of Youth For Christ and sang with a group known as "The Oasis" until going solo in 1981. She also worked closely at this time with keyboard player Chris Rolinson, who contributed extensively to the unique sound on her first "new wave" style album, Future Eyes. He also toured with her on her first United States tour, where she opened for <a href=#>Phil Keaggy</a>. As Walsh enjoyed some success both in the United Kingdom and America as a CCM musician, she was asked by minister <a href=#>Pat Robertson</a> to serve as a co-host of his television talk-show, The 700 Club in 1987. Walsh served in this capacity into 1992 and also hosted her own talk-show, Heart to Heart with Sheila Walsh.</p><p>Sheila Walsh (born 5 July 1956) is a Scottish-born American contemporary Christian vocalist, songwriter, evangelist, author, inspirational speaker, and talk-show host.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfqLWmtcuaZLCZnKi1bq3UrZ%2Boql2otq%2BzxKs%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./significado-de-cancionero-de-jose-jose.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Significado de Cancionero de Jos Jos">&larr;
