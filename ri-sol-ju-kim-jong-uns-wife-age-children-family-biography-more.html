Since 2011, Kim Jong-un has been the Supreme Leader of North Korea.</strong></p><p>From official sources, not much is known about the First Lady of North Korea, but there have been many rumors about her.</p><figure id=attachment_20554 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-20554 class="wp-caption aligncenter">Ri Sol-ju</figure><h2>Ri Sol-ju Bio</h2><p>Ri Sol-ju was born between 1985 and 1989 in Ch6ngjin, North Hamgyong Province, North Korea. As of 2022, he is 33 to 37 years old. She went to Geumsung 2 Middle School in Pyongyang and graduated from there. She then went to China to study and majored in vocal music. Later, she went to Kim II-sung University in Pyongyang, North Korea, to get a master’s or doctorate in science.</p><p><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;Amma Sri Karunamayi Wiki, Age, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</strong></p><h2>Appearances in public</h2><p>In North Korea, she first came to the attention of the public in 2012, when she was seen at a gala concert for the country’s most important people. She was wearing a Chanel-style slim black suit. After that, she was seen at a kindergarten, where photographers took pictures of her smiling at children playing on a slide, and then at the opening of a Pyongyang amusement park. She was called a mysterious woman at the time because she was often seen with Kim Jong-un in North Korean media. Soon, people started to think that Kim Jong-un had gotten a wife and named her Comrade Ri Sol-ju. Analysts of North Korea thought that Ri Sol-ju’s public appearance was a big deal because it showed that Kim Jong-un was different from his father, Kim Jong-il, who was known for marrying beautiful performers but never letting the public meet them.</p><h2>The leader’s wife in North Korea</h2><p>In April 2018, North Korea’s state media called Ri Sol-ju the “respected first lady,” which was a step up from calling her a “comrade.” The title was first given to Kim II-sung’s second wife, Kim Song-ae, in 1974. Ri Sol-ju attended a Chinese ballet performance in Pyongyang over the weekend. Star anchorwoman Ri Chun-hee, who often makes big announcements, made the title change official. In 2018, Ri took on a diplomatic role when she and her husband went to China. There, they met China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, and his wife, Peng Liyuan.</p><p><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;Sobhita Dhulipala Age, Height, Family, Boyfriend, Biography, Net Worth &amp;amp; More</strong></p><h2>Early years</h2><p>We don’t know much for sure about Ri’s background. Some analysts have even said that her name is “almost certainly a pseudonym.”</p><p>People have said that she was born between 1985[1] and 1989. Ri’s mother is the head of a gynecology ward, and her father is a professor. It is said that Ri’s family is part of the political elite. She is said to have finished middle school at Geumsung 2 in Pyongyang and then gone to China to study vocal music. Ri Pyong-chol, a former general of the Korean People’s Army Air and Anti-Air Force and a close advisor to Kim Jong-un, is said to be her relative. Some commentators and the newspaper JoongAng Ilbo have said that Ri is a singer in the Unhasu Orchestra, which has performed overseas several times. North Korean officials are said to be “trying to erase her past as a singer and entertainer by seizing popular bootleg CDs of her performances,” such as her singing the song “Sobaeksu.” She may have been a graduate student at Kim Il-sung University in 2012, where she was working toward a PhD in science.</p><p>During the Asian Athletics Championships in 2005, Ri went to South Korea as a member of the North Korean cheerleading team. It was said that she and 90 other cheerleaders chanted “We are one!” During the trip, Ri is said to have told a South Korean teacher, “We want to take classes from the South’s teachers as soon as we can.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/smartindianews.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Ri-Sol-ju-249x300.png><h2>Marriage and having kids</h2><p>The BBC said that Kim’s father, Kim Jong-il, arranged his son’s marriage quickly after he had a stroke in 2008. The analyst was quoted in The Korea Times of South Korea. It is said that they got married in 2009.</p><p>Ri might have had a baby in 2010, and sources say it was a boy.</p><p>In December 2012, it was said that Ri was clearly pregnant, but officials in North Korea did not say anything. In March 2013, Dennis Rodman, a former NBA player, went to North Korea to see Kim Jong-un. In September 2013, Rodman told The Guardian that the couple’s daughter’s name is Kim Ju-ae. He said that Jong-un was a “good dad” with a “beautiful family.”</p><p>South Korean intelligence officials said that Ri had a third child in February 2017, but they didn’t know what gender it was.</p><p>In November 2022, North Korean state media showed pictures of Kim Jong-un and his young daughter holding hands at the Pyongyang site of a missile launch. Even though the child’s name was not given, people think it is Kim Ju-ae.</p><p>Family Ri Sol-Ju What’s Ri Sol-age? Ju’s She was born on September 28, 1986, in Pyongyang, North Korea. As of 2020, she will be 30 years old. When it comes to her family, her parents’ names aren’t known, but her father is a professor at a top North Korean university and her mother is the head of Gynecology at a private hospital. Not much is known about her siblings. But we’ll let you know as soon as we know the earliest.</p><h2>Early life and family history of Ri Sol-Ju</h2><p>If you wanted to know more about this woman, you would have to start with her name. But there are also some disagreements about what her real name is. Some sources have said that her real name might be Lee Seol-Ju, which has made people wonder if her well-known name, Ri Sol-ju, is really her real name. There is also no reliable information about her exact date of birth, but it is thought that she was born between 1985 and 1989. The North Korean government has not yet said anything about this.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/smartindianews.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Ri-Sol-ju-1-300x289.png><p>From what we know about her, she was born to a professor father and a gynecology department head mother. She is also said to be related to Ri Pyong-Chol, a former air force general who is a close advisor to Kim Jong-un. She is said to have gone to Geumsung 2 Middle School in Pyongyang before going to China to continue her education, where she mostly studied music. She also has a Ph.D. and a Master’s degree in science, both of which she got at Kim il-Sung University.</p><p>Ri Sol-ju used to play music on stage and be a part of a North Korean group called the Unhasu Orchestra. More information makes us think that she was a cheerleader and was on the North Korean team that went to the Asian Athletics Championships in 2005, even though there is no clear proof to back it up.</p><p>Even though this sounds crazy, it is important to note that the North Korean government is reportedly trying to erase everything about the First Lady’s past by any means necessary. They have already gotten all of the recordings she had been in before. The rest of what you need to know about Kim Jong Un’s wife is below.</p><h2>The leader’s wife in North Korea</h2><p>In 2012, Ri made a few public appearances with Kim Jong-un, which made people wonder who she was. South Korean intelligence officials made a mistake and thought she was Hyon Song-wol, a former singer for the Pochonbo Electronic Ensemble, a popular North Korean music group. But on July 25, 2012, North Korean state media said that she was really Kim’s wife, calling her “Comrade Ri Sol-ju, his wife.” Kim’s father, Kim Jong-il, never talked about his wives in public, so the news of the marriage was a change from that.</p><p>At an elite gala concert in North Korea in July 2012, Ri was stylishly “dressed in a trim black suit in the Chanel tradition,” which was unusual for a North Korean woman. Analysts see Kim Jong-marriage, un’s along with other recent changes like the firing of a top hard-line general, as “a continuation of what is either a policy change or a propaganda offensive, or both.”</p><p>In September 2012, Kenji Fujimoto, who used to be Kim Jong-personal il’s sushi chef, said that he met Ri while he was in North Korea. He said that she was “just so lovely… I can’t explain how soft her voice is…” As a farewell gift, Ri gave Fujimoto a handbag by Christian Dior that Ri was said to have been carrying before.</p><p>From 2012 to 2014, Ri was sometimes shown in North Korean media when she went to events with her husband. After that, she was rarely shown. She was out of the public eye for a long time in 2015, 2016, and 2017.</p><p>In 2018, Ri started working as a diplomat. In March 2018, she and her husband went to China, where they met the leader of China, Xi Jinping, and his wife, Peng Liyuan. [not clear enough to check] Before the inter-Korean summit in April 2018, Ri’s title was changed from “Comrade” to “Respected First Lady.” This was the first time that title had been used in North Korea since 1974, when Kim Il-second sung’s wife, Kim Song-ae, held it. Ri Chun-hee, a famous news anchorwoman who often makes big announcements, read about the change in title in a news report. Ri was the first wife of a North Korean leader to go to the summit. There, she met Kim Jung-sook, the First Lady of South Korea, for the first time. During their meetings that year, the two first ladies were seen to be close to each other. In May, she met with US diplomats and helped calm things down. She also helped organize the June 2019 visit of China’s leader, Xi Jinping, and his wife, Peng Liyuan.</p><h2>Motherhood</h2><p>Since 2012, there have been rumors that Ri Sol-ju has gone missing. Some news outlets have suggested that she was killed for disobedience, which Kim Jong doesn’t seem to like. He is known to have killed several high-ranking military and political leaders of North Korea over very small things. People also said that she might have gone missing because she was pregnant. Since she was going to give birth to the next leader of North Korea, keeping her away from the public seemed like the best thing to do.</p><p>When she showed up at a military event in December 2012, she looked like she was pregnant, which showed that all the rumors were false. North Korean officials didn’t say anything about the reports that she was pregnant, but Dennis Rodman, an NBA player who is a close friend of Kim and visited him in early 2013, said that Ri had just given birth to a beautiful daughter. Some reports also said that the birth was forced so that the baby would be born in 2012, which was the 100th anniversary of North Korea’s founder, Kim Il-Sung. Then, “The Guardian” said that the reports were pretty much true and that the daughter is real and has been named Ju-ae.</p><p><strong>Read More:&nbsp;Nagraj Manjule Wiki, Biography, Age, Wife, Family, Education, Girlfriend, Height, Weight, Movies List, Career, Profession, Net Worth</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrBorjKrKuonJGue6S7zGipomWjpLluttRmoqKlXZ%2B8r7OMrqWsZaees6Z5wKCcZpuYnrmlvsSnZJ%2BZnZ65unnBoqagqpGltbp5zKipnmc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./robert-irwin-net-worth-2020-2021.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Robert Irwin Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Dating, Bio-Wiki">&larr;
