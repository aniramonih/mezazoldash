His successful racing career is not without some recognition, including being named NASCAR K&N Pro Series East Rookie of the Year in 2012 and Champion, Nationwide Series Rookie of the Year in 2013, Overall Daytona 24 Hours Winner in 2015, and several others.</p><p>If you’re familiar with the love story between popular American car racer Kyle Larson and his long-time girlfriend and baby mom Katelyn Sweet, you know that Kyle has finally asked the big question and asked Katelyn to marry him. Katelyn, who is the sister of Brad Sweet, another racing driver and close friend of Kyle’s, has been in love with the racing car star for a long time. Although the timing of their first meeting is unclear, the couple has dated long enough to have two children together, and fans who believe the marriage proposal has been a long time coming welcomed the engagement with positive reactions and expect the wedding ceremony to follow close behind.</p><h2><strong>Brief Bio of Kyle Larson, Age</strong></h2><p>The famous American professional stockcar racer Kyle Miyata Larson was born on July 31, 1992, in Sacramento, California. His parents are Mike and Janet Larson, who have two other children besides Kyle. The aspiring car racer saw his first motor racing experience a week after his birth but joined the gang at the age of seven. According to the records, Kyle received basic training while practicing his sport. He is considered a caring guy who loves the water and hopes to go on a cruise with his family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Kyle-Larson-Car.jpg><p>Kyle started out with outlaw karts in Northern California, and today he currently drives the Chevrolet SS No. 42 for Chip anassi Racing and competes full-time in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. Although he has a limited schedule with the Xfinity Series, where he drives a number 42 Chevrolet Camaro for CGR, the car racer is also involved in the Camping World Truck Series with the number 24 Chevrolet Silverado as a race car.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Carlos Bacca Bio, Height, Weight, Body Measurements, Other Facts</a></strong></p><h2><strong>Parents, Wife (Katelyn Sweet), Girlfriend</strong></h2><p>The famous racing car driver was born as the youngest of three siblings of the Japanese-American mother Janet Larson and the Caucasian father Mike Larson. It is on record that Kyle’s parents spent time in the Japanese internment camp in the past. A week after his birth, his parents took him to see his first car racing, and at the age of seven, he began to actively participate in the sport by driving outlaw karts in Northern California.</p><p>Kyle is currently in a relationship with Katelyn Sweet, a sister of his close friend Brad Sweet, who also drives race cars. Katelyn, who was born on July 28, 1991, is used to being in the spotlight because of her brother’s profession, but she is a nice and creative person herself. With her Twitter account, which opened in June 2010, she is present in social media. In addition to her social media account, Kyle’s beautiful friend has worked as an independent consultant for Rodan & Fields Skincare.</p><p>It has been suggested that the couple must have gotten to know each other through their shared passion for car racing. Although it was never discussed how they first met, it is very likely that they met at one of the after-parties and meetings for racing drivers. Their relationship has remained strong, and it seems unshakable. Although they are not yet married, the couple have two children together, their first child Owen Miyata Larson, a boy, was born on 22 December 2014, and more recently, on 7 March 2018, their second child Audrey Layne Larson was born.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Kyle-Larson-and-Girlfriend-Katelyn-Sweet.jpg><p>Kyle and his baby mama got engaged on December 22, 2017, and according to the driver of Chevrolet No. 42, the marriage proposal is long overdue. He has posted pictures of him and his soon-to-be-official family on social media, showing Katelyn swinging her giant engagement ring as she jet-sets off to New Zealand in the off-season. The couple seems to be in a great relationship and as Kyle Larson said, it’s about time and they couldn’t wait to spend the rest of their lives together and take care of their children.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Dominic Thiem Girlfriend, Gay, Age, Biography, Body Measurements</a></strong></p><h2><strong>Height, How Tall Is Kyle Larson?</strong></h2><p>The stock car racing driver is not very tall, unlike in the basketball games, great height is not a prerequisite for entry into car racing sports. Kyle stands at an average height of 5 feet 5 inches or 1.68 m. The American-born race car driver weighs 61 kg or 135 lb but details of his other body statistics are not currently available to the public.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kuLq4xGajmqqjpLtuw8ifnGajkamyrcXNZqqwnZWperGt0Z6lratdlrSmeceeoKCgpGK0qr7Ln6minZ6ZfA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kyle-machlachlan-returns-twin-peaks-series.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kyle MacLachlan set to return to Twin Peaks as FBI agent Dale Cooper">&larr;
