During the last years of his life, he was in a relationship with a student <a href=#><i><strong>Jasmine Pilchard-Gosnell</strong></i></a>. His ex-girlfriend <a href=#><strong>Rebecca Soteros</strong></a>, however, stayed away from limelight up until 2013.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple dated for a brief period of time and even has a daughter together but they never married. After fans noticed Paul's ex and his daughter, many want to know more about their relationship. And so do we, let's find out.</p><h2>Paul, "I was not the best Boyfriend to Rebecca"</h2><p>Hollywood star Paul Walker and his former girlfriend Rebecca Soteros started dating each other in the late 1990s. Neither Paul nor Rebecca ever mentioned any details about their affair.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/9/13/rebecca-soteros-1-1568367043578.jpg><p>During the time, the couple met each other, both of them were in their early twenties. Soteros wanted to marry Walker and even confronted him, but he was not ready at the time.</p><p>After some time, on November 4, 1998, Paul and Rebecca welcomed their first child <a href=#><i><strong>Meadow Rain Walker</strong></i></a>. Soteros again proposed Paul to tie the knot, but he refused by saying that he was not mature enough. It left him devastated as he did not feel good, and in his own words, he felt like an 'evil SOB.'&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/9/13/HT_paul_walker_meadow_jef_140320_4_16x9_1600-1568367097602.jpg><p>&nbsp;In an interview, Walker said that he was never the best boyfriend to Rebecca, but the pair seems to have moved on. He also stated that,</p><p>"I knew where I was at with Chicks and having fun. I mean, I was sleeping with her friends, for crying out loud. You know what I mean?".</p><p>He further added,</p><p>"I was an animal, and so I want to be there and my heart wants to be in it, but the mind just isn't following it. I love my daughter so much, and I love her mom too. We get along so well as a result of my playing it the way that I did".</p><p><i><strong>Also know more about, </strong></i><a href=#><i><strong>Teresa Terry and her married life with Todd Chrisley</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p><h2>The Custody Battle of Meadow Rain Walker...</h2><p>Rebecca Soteros always had a drinking problem which Paul was very aware of. Meadow lived with her mom, but as her drinking problem grew, Meadow moved away from her mom and started living with her dad and his new girlfriend, Jasmine.</p><p>After the death of Walker, though Meadow is at the center of the child custody battle between Rebecca and Paul's mom <strong>Cheryl</strong>. In 2013, after Paul's death, Cheryl filed a petition to have guardianship over Meadow.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/9/13/cheryl%20walker%20and%20rebecca%20soteros_20171031022204-1568367190585.jpg><p>Because of Rebecca's drinking problem and her two DUIs arrest, Cheryl filed for <a href=# rel=nofollow>guardianship</a> and wanted full custody. After some drama, Cheryl agreed to withdraw the custodial case only if Rebecca goes to rehabilitation for her drinking problem.</p><h2>What's her Current Relationship Status?</h2><p>As per many online sites, she is currently in a romantic affair with <strong>Nicko McBrian</strong> who is a drummer of the heavy metal band <i>Iron Maiden</i>. But that's not true at all.</p><p>FYI, Nicko McBrain's wife's name is <strong>Rebecca McBrain</strong> who is a completely different person than Rebecca Soteros. Many online tabloids seem to confuse between them and posted Rebecca McBrain as the woman who dated Paul Walker.&nbsp;</p><p>Talking about Soteros, after the custody battle, she cleaned up herself and now has full custody of her daughter Meadow. She is currently living in Hawaii, but as of now, there is no evidence of her new fling. On the other hand, Meadow is currently continuing her philanthropic work that her father left with her foundation The Paul Walker Foundation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/9/13/Adrien%20Greiner-1568367539956.JPG><p><i><strong>&nbsp;For further updates, keep reading </strong></i><a href=# rel=nofollow><i><strong>Marriedceleb.com</strong></i></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqucm52TmK5uv86tnKuno2Kur7CMqZiupF2srq23xKtkqZmjqXqzscuaq6Knnqi1qrw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./lincoln-riley-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lincoln Riley Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">&larr;
