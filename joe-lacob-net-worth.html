You will find information on his net worth, age, wife, height, and other important details about him.</p><p>Joseph Steven Lacob was born in the United States on January 10, 1956. He is a business executive. He is a partner at Kleiner Perkins and the Golden State Warriors’ majority owner (NBA).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Joe Lacob: Net Worth 2023</h2><p><strong>American businessman Joe Lacob has a <a href=#>net worth</a> of $3 billion as of 2023.</strong> After amassing a fortune as a venture capitalist, Joe Lacob is best known as the main owner of the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association.</p><p>In 2010, Lacob and a consortium of investors, led by Peter Guber, paid $450 million for the Warriors. A few months prior to the acquisition, the Warriors picked Stephen Curry, an unimpressive college player.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Joe Lacob: Early Life Details</h2><p>Lacob was raised in a Jewish home in New Bedford, Massachusetts. Joe shifted his allegiance from the Los Angeles Lakers to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim after relocating to Anaheim, California with his family.</p><p>1978 saw Lacob graduate from the University of California, Irvine with a bachelor’s degree in biological sciences. In addition, he holds a master’s degree in public health (epidemiology) from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and a master’s degree in business administration (MBA) from the Stanford Graduate School of Business.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Joe Lacob: Personal Life Details</h2><p>Lacob is no longer married to his first wife, Laurie Kraus. With Laurie, he has two boys and two daughters. Currently, he is married to Nicole Curran.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Joe Lacob: Career Details</h2><p>Lacob has been a partner at the company Kleiner Perkins, which invests in venture capital, since 1987. Most of his money has gone to companies in the fields of energy, life sciences, medical technology, and the Internet.</p><p>These include AutoTrader.com, NuVasive, and Align Technology. Lacob was an executive at Cetus Corporation, which is now Chiron, FHP International, which is a health maintenance organisation, and Booz, Allen & Hamilton, which is a management consulting firm, before he joined Kleiner Perkins.</p><p>In interviews, he said that his degree in epidemiology gave him a background in statistics, which helped him with that part of his longtime interest in sports.</p><h2><strong>Golden State Warriors Purchase</strong></h2><p style=color:#252525>The Golden State Warriors were bought for $450 million by Joe Lacob and a group of investors in 2010. Before he could finish the purchase, he had to sell his stake in the Celtics. Lacob had been a season ticket holder for ten years before he bought the Warriors. In the months before he was bought, the team drafted Stephen Curry, a player from Davidson College who wasn’t very well known.</p><p style=color:#252525>After a few years, Curry had become one of the biggest stars in the league. Stephen Curry has led the Warriors to three NBA titles as of this writing. The Warriors were worth $2.6 billion in 2017. They were worth $3.5 billion in 2019. At the time this was written, the Warriors were thought to be worth about $6 billion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-135-1024x721.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Joe Lacob: Beyonce Controversy</h2><p>Nicole Curren, Joe’s wife, got a little bit of attention on June 5, 2019, when she sat next to Beyonce at Game 3 of the NBA Finals. At one point, Nicole was seen talking to Jay-Z while leaning over Beyonce. The next day, Nicole was one of the most talked about things on Twitter because Beyonce’s face looked so angry at the move.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Joe Lacob: Real Estate</h2><p>Joe bought a beach house in Malibu for $29 million in September 2019. His main home is a 14,000-square-foot mansion in Atherton, California, that cost him $19.8 million in 2007.</p><p>His Atherton home is right across the street from Sergey Brin’s $180 million ranch compound and down the street from Jan Koum’s $100 million compounds, which he bought when he started Whatsapp. Joe and Jan both bought homes in Malibu around the same time, but Jan’s home, which cost $125 million, was a lot more expensive.</p><p><strong>Related Stories Recommended By Writer:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>Randy Johnson’s Net Worth In 2022, How Much Money Did Randy Johnson Make In His Career?</a></li><li><a href=#>Angela Lansbury Net Worth: How Much Money Did The Actress Have?</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfo7K1edaoqa2gX5%2B8pnnLmpqoml2jsrV51qipraBfaIJ0go9o</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./john-graham-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="John Graham Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">&larr;
