Love you Deep bab. Cheers To the best mother & more decades of Love and good health with u.</strong>“</p><p>Corey celebrated his 41st birthday on November 10, and Kris took her turn to wish Corey a happy birthday on Instagram.</p><p>“<strong>Happy birthday to my love @coreygamble!!</strong></p><p><strong>“You are the most amazing partner, best friend, confidant, travel aficionado, therapist, problem solver, golf buddy, protector, advisor, and the best, most wonderful man to my kids and my grandkids!!!</strong></p><p><strong>“You are such a special part of my heart and soul and I love you so very much babe… thank you for all you are in my life!!
