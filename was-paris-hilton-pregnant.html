Recently, the 42-year-old opened up about having an abortion in her early 20s in an<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> interview with Glamour</a>&nbsp;something she had previously avoided talking about.</p><p>She said:</p><p>I consider it crucial. There is so much politics and all that, but it’s a woman’s body… What good would it do to make a law about that? I really believe that it’s your body, your choice. It baffles me that they legislate your s*xual and reproductive choices. If it were the other way around with the guy’s things would be very different.</p><p><strong>The couple recently welcomed their first child, a son via surrogate.</strong> The new mother said:</p><p>It’s always been my dream to be a mother and I’m so happy that Carter and I found each other. Our hearts are bursting with love for our baby boy and we couldn’t be more thrilled to begin this new chapter in our lives as a family.</p><p>Hilton announced the arrival of her baby boy with a close-up photo of the infant holding onto her thumb on Instagram. ‘You are already loved beyond words,’ she gushed.</p><p><strong>Some of your favorite celebrities have recently announced their pregnancy news and you can read about it by clicking on the links we’ve provided below:</strong></p><h2><strong>Why did Paris Hilton Choose a Surrogate to Deliver her child?</strong></h2><p>Paris Hilton recently spoke out about her decision to have a son via surrogate citing three main motivations for her decision. According to a story published in Glamour UK on February 23 aforementioned, the 41-year-old reality star said that she decided to have baby Phoenix via surrogacy in part because she has seen a live birth and found it terrifying.</p><p>She said:</p><p>When I was in The Simple Life, I had to be in a room when a woman was giving birth and that traumatized me that she would use a surrogate even if she were only 20 years old.</p><p>She expressed her desire for a family. Just the actual doing of it is physically demanding. Please don’t think I’m not afraid. Both giving birth and dying to terrify me more than anything else.</p><p>She went on to say that her reluctance to get the prenatal care she would need because of the abuse she suffered in high school in Provo Canyon, Utah is a direct result of that trauma.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Was-Paris-Hilton-Pregnant.jpg><p>According to Hilton, surrogacy ended up being her best choice. Kim Kardashian, a friend from childhood was a huge help to her. After hearing Kim recommend IVF, I decided to try it out for myself. This is why I stocked up on frozen eggs, she explains.</p><p>Hilton told, Kim also informed me about surrogacy. Since I had such a positive experience with Dr. Huang, I’ve continued to use him. His concierge staff handles everything and conducts an interview with the surrogate to ensure their health.</p><p>Recently, Hilton <a href=# rel=noopener>explained on her podcast “This is Paris”</a>, why she hasn’t shown her son’s face in public.</p><p>She said:</p><p>We’ve just been keeping everything really private because we’re so excited to start our family and can’t wait for you to see him.</p><p>She claimed that not even her mother Kathy Hilton or her sister Nicky Hilton Rothschild knew that she was pregnant. She continued</p><p>I just feel that my life has been so public and I’ve never really had anything just be mine. I just had this strong urge that I wanted to go on this trip with just the two of us.</p><p>You can follow our <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Twitter page</strong></a> to stay up to date on all the latest news and information about your favorite celebrities, whether it’s their personal lives, careers or anything else that is related to their life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpbGdgZ3xzg46wmKxloJa%2Fqr%2BMoaClrJ%2BjerG%2BxKClmqakZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jenna-ortega-percy-hynes-allegations-opinion.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Is Jenna Ortega Held Responsible for the Percy Hynes White Allegations?">&larr;
