In December 2022, Rife signed a contract with Creative Artists Agency (CAA). He released a special with the same name, Matthew Steven Rife (2023), on Valentine’s Day.</p><h2><span id=Tattoos_of_comedian_Matt_Rife_Designs_And_Meanings>Tattoos of comedian Matt Rife: Designs And Meanings</span></h2><p>Matt Rife appears to enjoy getting inked, as evidenced by the symbolic tattoos he has on his left arm. On his arm, Matt has three visible tattoos, which he has flashed in a few Instagram photos.</p><p>Unfortunately, the comedian has not yet revealed to his fans the meaning of the Matt Rife Tattoo, therefore little information was discovered on the subject.</p><p>On his left shoulder, Matt has a tattoo of a howling wolf, but its meaning has not yet been made clear. Additionally, he has a tattoo on his wrist with writing that cannot be seen in images.</p><p>Last but not least, he provided a photo of his most recent tattoo, which is also written. “Stranded At The Drive-In,” which appears to be an inside tale that he has not expanded on, is written on the tattoo.</p><p>However, we hope Matt soon feels secure enough to reveal the meanings of his tattoos to his admirers.</p><h2><span id=Family_and_ethnicity_of_Matt_Rife>Family and ethnicity of Matt Rife</span></h2><p>Given how little the comedian has revealed about himself and his family, Matt comes across as being a touch private.</p><p>Matt’s mother is April Rife, and his stepfather is Jason Sievers, according to Freshers Live. However, there wasn’t a lot of information online about them.</p><p>In the same way, Matt has made no mention of his siblings, making it impossible to corroborate anything while writing this story. According to Dreshare, Matt is also a Christian and is White Caucasian in ethnicity.</p><p>Sadly, no additional information about Matt’s family was discovered because, unlike Matt Rife, they abhor being in the spotlight.</p><h2><span id=2023_Matt_Rife_Net_Worth>2023 Matt Rife Net Worth</span></h2><p>Additionally, Matt has not disclosed his wealth, so the amount of his wealth could not be determined when writing this article.</p><p>Matt’s estimated net worth as of 2023 is over $1.5 million, based on a number of sources. The Comedian himself has not yet confirmed this information, though.</p><p>As he has not shared a photo of himself flexing those, Rife does not appear to love spending money on items like supercars, pricey clothing, and others. He did, however, mention in an interview that he has a sizable collection of shoes.</p><p>He uses the handle @mattrife, has over 1.5 million followers as of the time of writing, and appears to be rather active there as he regularly updates his profile.</p><p>Rife has over 1.1k posts as at the time of writing this article and primarily uses it to upload images of his stand-up comedy performances, pictures of himself, pictures of him traveling, and other images.</p><h3><span id=Also_Read_Tantoo_Cardinal8217s_Wife_Kids_And_Family><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Tantoo Cardinal&#39;s Wife, Kids, And Family"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":37248,"10":2,"11":0,"15":"Arial","18":1}' data-sheets-hyperlink=https://popularbio.com/tantoo-cardinals-wife-kids-and-family/ data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/tantoo-cardinals-wife-kids-and-family/"}{"1":51}'><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Also Read: </a><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Tantoo Cardinal’s Wife, Kids, And Family</a></span></span></h3><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Comedian</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Sandro Tonali Net Worth | How Rich Is He?
