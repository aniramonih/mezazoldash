This Robert Ross Bio explores everything you need to know about him.</span></p><h3><b>Meet Robert Ross, Bill & Melinda Gates Daughter Phoebe Gates Boyfriend</b></h3><p><span>Shortly after Bill Gates’s romance with fellow tech executive and tennis fanatic, </span><a href=#><span>Paula Hurd</span></a><span> was made public in early 2023, his daughter Phoebe Gates also opened up about her dating life. And the lucky man, she was in love with was Robert Ross.</span></p><p><span>However, Phoebe didn’t discuss her relationship to flaunt her boyfriend to the world. Rather, the revelation came after she received multiple backlashes online about being in an interracial relationship. She said that she was she’s constantly dealing with “misconceptions and conspiracy theories about my family and my relationship with my boyfriend.”</span></p><p><span>So, she was putting her foot down about it. “It’s 2023. I’m done being memed for being in an interracial relationship,” she added,</span></p><p><span>This also means that Robert and Melinda were already together for quite a while then.

But in Jan 2023, they were photographed together at the Australian Open as they watched the Men’s Singles Final in Melbourne before a source revealed “They’re inseparable. They’ve been together over a year, and she’s always described as a ‘mystery woman,’ but it’s no mystery to their inner circle that they’re in a romantic relationship.”</span></p><p><span>For those who don’t know, Bill Gates divorced Melinda French Gates in August 2021 for “some reason” he didn’t want to talk about.
