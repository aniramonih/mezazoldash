’60s.&nbsp;Donahue rose to fame in the early ’60s for his roles in a number of Warner Bros films, but unfortunately his career didn’t go as he would like.&nbsp;Read on for the highlights and the struggles he encountered along the way.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Troy Donahue Bio</span></strong></h2><p><span>Troy Donahue was born Merle Johnson Jr. Donahue aspired to be an actor from a young age.&nbsp;However, his parents never supported him, instead wanting him to pursue a career in a more stable field such as medicine, law or in the culinary industry.&nbsp;Donahue got his acting genes from his mother, who was a stage actress, while his father worked at General Motors as a film department manager.</span></p><p><span>Raised in New York City, Donahue was well connected to Long Island and was exposed to many Broadway actors.&nbsp;Donahue followed his parents’ wishes and enrolled in a New York military academy.&nbsp;However, his plans to attend the US Military Academy at West Point were dashed by a knee injury.&nbsp;Unfortunately, his father passed away when he was 14 years old.&nbsp;He then worked for a short time as a messenger in a film company founded by his father.&nbsp;He then enrolled at Columbia University to study journalism.&nbsp;At school, his passion for acting won him over and saw him move to Hollywood.</span></p><p><span>In Hollywood, Donahue met an agent Henry Willson, who changed his name from Merle Johnson to Troy Donahue.&nbsp;To start his professional career, Donahue signed a contract with Universal Pictures in 1956, but was only allowed to act in small roles until 1959, when his new contract with Warner Bros. landed him a role in&nbsp;</span><span>A Summer Place</span><span>&nbsp;that became his breakthrough film.</span></p><p><span>Donahue was then typecast in a number of films and soap operas aimed at teenagers, granting him teen idol status.&nbsp;Unfortunately, in the mid-’60s, Donahue found himself on a downward spiral in his career, in part due to the fact that his youthful audiences had matured and his subsequent films were no longer appealing.</span></p><p><span>Donahue lived at the height of his luxury career in the early ’60s, but as his career declined, he realized his meager pay, far from what a star should earn, wasn’t enough to sustain his lifestyle.&nbsp;He had to file for bankruptcy and after that it was never the same.</span></p><p><span>A frustrated Donahue delved into drugs and alcohol to the detriment of a career he was struggling to revive.&nbsp;He received $10,000 for a small part in 1974’s&nbsp;</span><span>The Godfather Part II</span><span>&nbsp;which sadly would be his most enduring role, despite appearing in a dozen other films.&nbsp;Troy Donahue got his addiction under control in the ’80s but couldn’t quite complete his career comeback.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Is he dead or alive?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Troy Donahue passed away on September 2nd, 2001 after suffering a heart attack a few days earlier on August 30th.&nbsp;Despite being unable to return to the saddle, Troy Donahue continued to act in parts.&nbsp;His last film role was in 2000’s&nbsp;</span><span>The Boys Behind the Desk</span><span>&nbsp;His career might not have properly propelled him back into the limelight, but Troy Donahue found peace in his final years.&nbsp;After sobering up with the help of Alcoholics Anonymous, he became a Christian and credited his faith with helping him find strength.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Troy Donahue’s spouse and son</span></strong></h2><p><span>Atypical for teenage idols, Troy Donahue has had romantic relationships with many women in his life.&nbsp;He had four short-lived marriages, all of which ended in divorce.&nbsp;The chains of divorce were undoubtedly part of what compounded his problems with his profession.&nbsp;His spouses included actress Suzanne Pleshette (1964);&nbsp;Valerie Allen (1966 – 1968), Alma Sharpe (1969 – 1972) and Vicki Taylor (1979 – 1981).&nbsp;From the 1990s until his death, Donahue was in a relationship with Chinese-American opera singer Zheng Cao.</span></p><p><span>Troy Donahue never had a child with either of his child wives, however, one of the women he casually romanced in the ’60s brought it to his knowledge in the ’80s that he had fathered a son with her.&nbsp;She introduced him to the boy named Sean, who was already a teenager in his eighties.&nbsp;Sean had known all along that Troy Donahue was his father.</span></p><h2><strong><span>was he gay</span></strong></h2><p><span>This is reflected in his diverse relationships with women, Troy Donahue was not gay.&nbsp;He himself confirmed this in the 80s after rumors about his sexual preferences began to surface.&nbsp;Turns out Donahue was mistaken for a Hollywood actor.</span></p><p class=postsid
