In referring to Swanson, Granny would always say: "We's lookalikes, y'know".</td></tr><tr readability=19.183174224344><td>3</td><td>Most biographers overlook her appearance on the ABC TV variety show <a href=#>The Hollywood Palace</a> (1964). At the end of the first winter-spring season, series producers <a href=#>Nick Vanoff</a> and <a href=#>William O. Harbach</a> scheduled the show's host <a href=#>Gene Barry</a> with guest stars Swanson and <a href=#>Buster Keaton</a> to appear together in a comedy sketch. Keaton was at that time appearing in <a href=#>It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World</a> (1963). Bringing famous Hollywood film stars onto the show was the producers' main goal. Getting Swanson and Keaton on the show was considered a coup and an opportunity to promote the film. The sketch starred Swanson as Cleopatra and Keaton as Marc Antony, staged on a stepped Roman platform terrace surrounded by a 20-inch-high parapet wall and Roman columns, with the pair falling in love. It was written by <a href=#>Joe Bigelow</a> and <a href=#>Jay Burton</a>, but director <a href=#>Grey Lockwood</a> encouraged Swanson and Keaton to contribute any bits, routines and ideas that they wanted to, which they did. On the first day of rehearsal Swanson was on the stage, gazing up at the lighting fixtures overhead. She asked for lighting director <a href=#>Jack Denton</a> to come to the stage, which he did, and Swanson began pointing out how she wanted which lights to focus on her and Keaton during the sketch--side light, key light, back light, which color gels to use, etc. Denton made sure that all of her suggestions were implemented. Keaton's idea was that the sketch should end with "Antony" and "Cleopatra" sitting on the parapet wall bench, join hands, and fall backwards out of sight over the wall. He and Swanson rehearsed the fall several times, and did the stunt themselves when it came time to actually shoot the scene for the show.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>4</td><td>Her father was of Swedish descent.

However, Swanson and her soon to be husband, <a href=#>William Dufty</a>, took it upon themselves (without being asked) to rewrite the screenplay. The "changes" in the script that Swanson desired were not ones that Summers wanted to include, so they mutually released each other from their contracts.
