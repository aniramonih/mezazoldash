People wanted a guinea pig to blame and they found it in his girlfriend Asia Argento whom they accused of cheating on him.</p><p>People said that it was this cheating that drove Anthony to commit suicide. There were also some sexual assault accusations levied against her. Asia was heartbroken by his death news and took some time to gather herself before she decided to clarify the haze surrounding her relationship with Anthony.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/4F5CFE3000000578-0-Asia_Argento-m-12_1535126357622.jpg><p>Asia told DailyMailTV:</p><p>“People say I murdered him. They say I killed him.&nbsp;I understand that the world needs to find a reason. I would like to find a reason too,”</p><p>She added:</p><p>“People need to think that he killed himself for something like this. He cheated on me too. It wasn’t a problem for us.”</p><p>She continued:</p><p>“He was a man who traveled 265 days a year. When we saw each other, we took really great pleasure in each other’s presence, but we are not children. We are grown-ups.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Asia_Argento_experiences_guilt_post-death_of_Anthony_Bourdain></span>Asia Argento experiences guilt post-death of Anthony Bourdain<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Asia, 43 feels sad that she did not see the pain which Anthony was experiencing. She said :</p><p>“What I do feel terrible about is that he had so much pain inside of him and I didn’t see it. I did not see it and for that I will feel guilty for the rest of my life,”</p><p>Anthony’s manager had broken the news of the suicide of Anthony to Asia. She recalled tearfully:</p><p>“I couldn’t speak, I couldn’t cry and then I started screaming.

His friend <a href=#>Eric Ripert</a> first noticed him in that condition and alerted the medical emergency and the police. They arrived on the scene and he was declared dead apparently due to suicide. Anthony was 61 at the time of his death.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/peo-5.jpg><p>Immediately after his death, fingers began to be pointed at his last girlfriend Asia Argento and people blamed her for his mental state and the suicide which followed it. Asia did not speak up at that time since she was overwhelmed by the suddenness of his death.</p><p>She could not take the blame on loose-tongued individuals and after gaining some strength decided to talk to the press about it and hence this interview.</p><p>Credit: thesun.co.uk</p><p>Share this</p><strong>Disclaimer Statement</strong>: Married Biography's editors wrote and updated all of this data based on their best knowledge and understanding. <a href=#>Married Biography</a> does not guarantee these opinions or ideas.
