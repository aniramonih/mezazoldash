Since his debut album in 2011, he has remained a popular and successful artist in the music industry.</p><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_Education>Early Life and Education</span></h2><p>Big Sean, born Sean Michael Leonard Anderson on March 25, 1988 in Santa Monica, California, was raised in Detroit, Michigan by his mother, a teacher, and grandmother, who served in the Army in World War II. Despite his references to the “west side” in his songs, he is actually referring to the west side of Detroit, not California. He graduated from Cass Technical High School with a 3.7 GPA.</p><h2><span id=Big_Seans_Career_Overview>Big Sean’s Career Overview</span></h2><p>Big Sean started rapping in high school and gained recognition through a weekly rap battle contest held by a local Detroit hip-hop station. In 2008, Kanye West signed him to his label, GOOD music. His debut album “Finally Famous” was released in 2011 and was certified platinum in 2017. His subsequent albums “Hall of Fame” and “Dark Sky Paradise” both received critical praise and were certified gold and platinum, respectively. He has also made numerous guest appearances on songs with popular artists, and has headlined four world tours. Big Sean is known for his fashion style and has an endorsement deal with Adidas. He also launched his own clothing company, Aura Gold, in 2013.</p><h2><span id=Awards_and_Nominations>Awards and Nominations</span></h2><p>Big Sean has received several nominations for prestigious awards such as the Grammys, MTV Video Music Awards, and BET Awards. He has been nominated four times for the Grammys, six times for the MTV Video Music Awards, and has won two. He has also won seven BET Awards, including Best New Artist in 2012.</p><h2><span id=Big_Seans_Relationships_and_Legal_Troubles>Big Sean’s Relationships and Legal Troubles</span></h2><p>Big Sean has been romantically linked to several famous women throughout his career. He dated “Glee” actress and singer Naya Rivera for over a year, before getting engaged in 2013. However, they announced their breakup in April 2014. He then dated Ariana Grande for eight months, before calling it quits. His most recent relationship was with singer Jhene Aiko from 2016-2019.</p><p>Unfortunately, Big Sean has also faced legal troubles. In August 2011, he was arrested for third-degree sexual assault after an incident at a concert in New York. However, he later pleaded guilty to second-degree unlawful imprisonment and was fined $750. As part of his plea bargain, the sexual assault charges were dropped.</p><h2><span id=Big_Sean_Buys_and_Sells_Luxury_Homes_in_California>Big Sean Buys and Sells Luxury Homes in California</span></h2><p>Rapper Big Sean purchased an 11,000 square foot home in Sherman Oaks, California for $8.7 million in 2017, originally listed for $11 million. The exclusive gated community, Mulholland Estates, was where the property was located. The home was previously owned by Guns N’ Roses guitarist Slash. In August 2021, Sean sold the house for $11.1 million and purchased a new home in Encino, California, for a little over $8 million in October 2021. The new home is located just over the hill from his former residence.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunCuyKBkrJ2Ro3qvsdNmrqiqpJ18</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./busta-rhymes-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Busta Rhymes Net Worth: How Did He Amass a Wealth of $20 Million?">&larr;
