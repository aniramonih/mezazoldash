Aaron Pedersen is an Australian actor who has appeared on Australian television and in films.</strong></p><p>Aaron is best known for his roles as Detective Jay Swan in Mystery Road and Goldstone in films and television shows. There are very few details about Lisa that are known by the media because she doesn’t have much love for the public eye despite her job. Be that as it may, we got a lot to tell you about her.</p><h3><b>Summary of Lisa Serma’s Biography</b></h3><ul><li><b>Full name: </b><span>Lisa Serma&nbsp;</span></li><li><b>Gender: </b><span>Female</span><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></li><li><b>Nationality: </b><span>American&nbsp;</span></li><li><b>Sexual Orientation: </b><span>Straight</span><b>&nbsp;</b></li><li><b>Religion: </b><span>Christianity</span><b>&nbsp;</b></li><li><b>Marital Status: </b><span>Single</span><b>&nbsp;</b></li><li><b>Famous for: </b><span>Being Aaron Pederson’s ex-wife</span></li></ul><h2><b>How Old is Lisa Serma?</b></h2><p>As of the time of writing this report, there are no details or data prints that may have indicated Lisa Serma’s age. This is not surprising as very little has been known of her till her marriage to her actor husband. However, Lisa Serma is projected to be between the ages of 40 to 45 years. This is not official, but it has been drawn from inferences made by looking at her pictures.</p><p>There is also no information about Lisa Serma’s childhood and the only member of her family <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">recorded on the internet</a> to date is a certain Aaron Pedersen is. This lack of information on Lisa may be more of her choice than the inability of the media to get information about her. Lisa has been described as someone who doesn’t care much about the attention that social media brings.</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/11/Collage-Maker-03-Nov-2022-09.56-AM.jpg alt width=1000 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><b>When Did Lisa Serma and Aaron Pedersen Meet?</b></h2><p>Lisa Serma met and married her ex-husband, Aaron Pedersen, in the year 1999. Details about their marriage was not reported by any media, which indicates that their wedding may have been a low-key one.</p><p>Describing his marriage to Lisa Serma to his peers, Aaron often fondly says that she was like a big sister to him. Hen is reported to have come from a broken home, therefore, one can understand why he would find comfort in his wife. Unfortunately, their marriage did not last long as they parted ways in 2000 following their divorce. This implied that Lisa and Aaron were officially only married from 1999 to 2000.</p><p>There was no statement from either of the couple as to why they decided to quit. This may have been due to Lisa Serma’s determination to keep her private affairs from the prying eyes of the media. Lisa promoted herself in her career as a stand-up comedian but we cannot deny the fact that people took more interest in her because of her husband, who was a renowned actor then. Lisa may be media shy, but that has not stopped her from doing what she loved doing best.</p><p>Meanwhile, due to the fact that details of Lisa Serma’s marriage to Aaron Pederson were kept away from the media, we could not initially say for sure if their marriage produced any children. However, Aaron Pedersen was later reported to have said that having children was not an option for him. He did not give much reasons for his decision but people could detect that it was down to the struggles his family had while growing up.</p><h2><strong>Meet Lisa Serma’s Ex-Husband, Aaron Pederson</strong></h2><p>Aaron Pederson is an Aboriginal Australian actor who was born on November 24, 1970, in Alice Springs, Australia’s Northern Territory’s third-largest town. He had a brief stint as a journalist before he ventured into acting.</p><p>The actor had a tough upbringing and often talked about how he and his family had to struggle when he was young. During his childhood, his mother couldn’t provide himself and his siblings with basic needs and this helped to shape his character.</p><p>Meanwhile, he has seven siblings, including a younger brother named Vinnie, who was raised in foster homes in Alice Springs. Only one year his junior, Vinnie has cerebral palsy, a mild intellectual disability that affects a person’s ability to move and maintain a balanced posture. It is the most common form of motor disability in children and unfortunately, there is no cure for it.</p><p>Aron’s ability to weather the storm and finally make it through his career was very comforting for the Australian actor who has been through it all with his 7 siblings.</p><p>Aaron Pederson made his acting debut in the 1994 miniseries Heartland, for which Cleo magazine selected him for Bachelor of the Year. He gained public attention over time and became well-known in 1995 as the host of the Australian game show, Gladiators Australia.</p><p>The popular television and film actor has not been reported to have made any comments about his marriage to his ex-wife Lisa Serma and has since moved on with his current partner, Sarah Pond, who is also his partner in film production. The couple has been together for two decades now and is often seen together at many public events. Aaron is reportedly worth over $2 million and he is expected to be worth even more in the nearest future as his illustrious acting career keeps flourishing.</p><h2><b>What Does Aaron Pedersen’s Ex-wife, Lisa Serma Do For a Living Now?&nbsp;</b></h2><p>According to reports, Lisa Serma is a comedian and she continues to hone her skills in entertaining people. There is nothing to prove that she is doing any other job after she started her career in the public eye following her marriage to Aaron. However, even though there are reports that confirm she’s is still a comedian to date, there are very few details about her mike skills, which points to the fact that she is a private person.</p><p>Just like most information about her, Lisa’s actual net worth has not yet been disclosed. But, she is said to have an estimated net worth of $1 million.</p><p><strong>In comparison, her AACTA International awardee ex-husband, Pedersen Aaron, has an estimated net worth of about $2 million. He has been able to earn this much through his career as an actor and a television show producer.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571KxmoJ2kYsGwecqnprBlnJ7AonnSnqmmmV2WrrO7zWannpyVp8Cmuoyer2avmZuycA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./green-acres-mall-valley-stream-ny-hours.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Green Acres Mall Valley Stream NY Hours">&larr;
