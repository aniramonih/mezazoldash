He is regarded as one of Tulsa’s toughest greasers, and he maintains a ‘tight-outfit’ when it comes to his greasers and their equipment. He and Dallas Winston are excellent friends, but they are also two sides of the same coin in their own lives.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>Also, who is Tim Shepard, the character from the novel The Outsiders?</h3><p>A friend of Dally’s, Tim Shepard is the commander of another band of greasers and a fellow greaser. Despite their differences, Tim and Dally have a mutual regard for one another. Ponyboy considers Tim to be a stray alley cat who is hungry and restless. After his group joins Ponyboy’s, Tim does not appear in the novel until the night of the rumble, when his character appears.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Furthermore, what are the personality characteristics of Tim Shepard?</h3><p>&nbsp;Personality. Tim is one of the few hoods that actually enjoys his life as a hood, and he serves as the commander of the Shepard gang. Like Dallas Winston and the Brumly lads, he has a gloomy and cruel expression on his face. With Ponyboy’s group, he enjoys an amicable connection, and he was once discovered in their living room in the morning, reading the newspaper.</p><p></p><h3>Another concern is why Tim Shepard is looking for Dally in the Outsiders in the first place.</h3><p>As described in Chapter 2, Tim Shepherd is on the lookout for Dally after his tyres were slashed, and Tim’s brother Curly “stood by and saw Dally do it.” In the event of a fair battle, Two-Bit believes Dally “deserves whatever he gets,” citing the fact that it takes a lot of hard work to earn the money to repair the tyres, as well as the fact that he has been apprehended.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Is Tim Shepard a SOC or a greaser, as some have suggested?</h3><p>He is Bob’s best friend as well as a fellow Socialist. Tim Shepard is an American actor and director. A fellow greaser, but not a member of the gang that the main protagonists are associated with. His greaser gang is harsher than the rest, and the members are referred to as “future felons” by the police. He is Dally’s biggest adversary as well as a close buddy.</p><p></p><h3>There were 35 related questions and answers found.</h3><p>Cherry Valance is a woman of unknown age.</p><p>sixteen-year-old</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>Who is the eldest character in The Outsiders and how old is he?</h3><p>Darrel Curtis is a well-known actor.</p><p></p><h3>In the film The Outsiders, was Sandy pregnant?</h3><p>Sodapop was one of the Curtis brothers from S.

Sandy, it appears, becomes pregnant, and she decides to relocate to Florida to live with her grandparents. Sandy rejects Soda’s marriage proposal after he makes it to her (or gives him no answer).</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>What is causing Darry to cry in the hospital?</h3><p>Pony notices that Darry is crying when he stares him in the eyes. Ponyboy recognises in that single second that Darry really does care about him, and that he was simply trying a little too hard. Darry is terrified of losing another loved one after the death of his parents. Cherry’s eagerness to share information with the greasers about Soc activity demonstrates that she is in a state of flux.</p><p></p><h3>In the film Outsiders, who is the protagonist?</h3><p>Ponyboy, Johnny, and Dally are heroes in S. E. Hinton’s novel The Outsiders because they are not afraid to take the initiative and help others when the situation calls for it. Ponyboy is a hero since he has saved lives and made friends with a gangster. In a similar vein, Johnny is a hero because he has demonstrated his heroic characteristics by assisting others.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>Sandy, one of the outsiders, is how old?</h3><p>Sandy Unknown Date of Birth I am seventeen years old. Affiliation A Brief History of the Greaser Family Grandmother</p><p></p><h3>Who was killed in the film Outsiders?</h3><p>The greasers come out on top against the Socs in the rumble. Dally arrives just in time for the combat; he has managed to evade capture and escape from the hospital. Ponyboy and Dally rush back to Johnny’s side after the fight, only to discover that he is in critical condition. When Johnny passes away, Dally loses her composure and flees the room in a fit of rage.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>What is the age of sodapop Curtis?</h3><p>He’s the most sensitive of the greasers (except from Johnny), and he enjoys reading books in his spare time. Sodapop (also known as “Soda”). A popular high school dropout who works at a gas station as the middle Curtis sibling, Curtis is 16 years old and the middle member of the Curtis family.</p><p></p><h3>“Can you tell me what Randy looks like from the outside?” “</h3><p>An imposing figure with a semi-Beatles-style hairdo, “As the kinder of the two Socs, Randy grows to admire Ponyboy after learning of the greasers’ valour in rescuing the children from the engulfed church.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>Why is Cherry unable to pay a visit to Johnny in the hospital?</h3><p>In the hospital, Cherry meets with Ponyboy to provide him information about the approaching rumble. Cherry informs Ponyboy that she will not be able to visit Johnny due to the fact that he is the one responsible for Bob’s death.</p><p></p><h3>What is the age of 2bit?</h3><p>Despite being eighteen and a half years old, Keith “Two-Bit” Mathews (spelled Matthews in the film credits) is still a Junior in high school. he also appears as a supporting character in The Outsiders He is the “eldest and wisest of the group,” as the saying goes. Aside from Darry (20), he’s the second-oldest of the three brothers and is notorious for stealing.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>What is the appearance of Curly Shepard?</h3><p>Because he is described as “a slender, catlike eighteen-year-old who looked like the model JD you see in movies and magazines,” it is possible that he physically resembles his brother, Tim Shepard. Tim Shepard is described as “a model JD you see in movies and publications.” He has wavy black hair, dark blue eyes, a scar that runs from his temple to his chin, and a nose that has been fractured, among other features.</p><p></p><h3>What is the appearance of a ponyboy?</h3><p>Ponyboy. Ponyboy, the protagonist of [I]The Outsiders, is fourteen years old and works as a greaser. With “light-brown, nearly red hair and greenish grey eyes,” he stands out from the crowd. He also wears his hair “longer than a lot of lads wear theirs, squared off in the back but long at the front and sides,” according to the author.</p><p></p><h3>What is the origin of the name “two bit Mathews”?</h3><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>Keith is his real name, although no one ever seems to remember it when he is introduced. He was given this moniker because he is adamant about not closing his mouth. Ponyboy, the novel’s narrator, recalls how Two-Bit ‘always had to get his two-bits in,’ as he describes Two-Bit.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-156 data-inserter-version=2></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiZ3xxfY6wn6hlmah6tbXMZqqhnaCdsrOwjKKlZqyYmnqwwdOsoJ2doqh7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-venus-morris-griffin-biography-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Venus Morris Griffin: Biography, Net Worth &amp;amp; more, Brief Intro">&larr;
