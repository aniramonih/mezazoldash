As a kid, Williams was involved in both baseball and music, as well as track and field. As a teenager competing at the 1984 Central American and Caribbean Junior Championships in Athletics, he won the gold medal in multiple track events.</p><h2 id=career-beginnings><strong>Career Beginnings</strong></h2><p>In 1985, New York Yankees scout Roberto Rivera spotted Williams, and intended to sign him.

Williams went on to play for the Yankees' Double-A team in Albany.</p><h2 id=new-york-yankees><strong>New York Yankees</strong></h2><p>Williams was called up to the majors in the second half of the 1991 season to replace Roberto Kelly, who had been injured.

Although Yankees' owner <a href=# title="George Steinbrenner Net Worth">George Steinbrenner</a> tried to get Williams traded, manager <a href=# title="Buck Showalter Net Worth">Buck Showalter</a> helped keep him.

In the postseason, Williams continued his success with a .429 batting average in the ALDS. He extended his hot streak through 1996, once again leading the Yankees to the ALDS. In the series, he batted .467. The Yankees subsequently advanced to the ALCS, defeating the Baltimore Orioles. Finally, Williams helped lead the team to a comeback in the World Series, giving the Yankees their first championship title since 1978.</p><p>The Yankees went on to another World Series victory in 1998; notably, they also posted a 114-48 regular-season record, at the time the best in AL history. Williams had another great year in 1999, recording over 200 hits and winning his third World Series and his third consecutive Gold Glove Award. The next year, he again won the World Series and the Gold Glove. Williams had another career highlight in 2002, when his .333 batting average and career-high 204 hits led to his first and only Silver Slugger Award. Williams began struggling with his form in 2005, the final year covered by his contract. Notably, he exhibited a weak arm and diminished batting and fielding abilities. Although the Yankees considered a buyout, the team ultimately decided to re-sign Williams for another year. In his last year with the Yankees in 2006, Williams scored his 2,300th career hit and his 443rd career double.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-175647 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Bernie-Williams1.jpg alt="Bernie Williams" width=395 height=498 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-175647 class=wp-caption-text>Ezra Shaw/Getty Images</p><h2 id=further-playing-retirement><strong>Further Playing and Retirement</strong></h2><p>Beyond the Yankees, Williams played for Puerto Rico in the MLB World Baseball Classic in 2006.
