By making this deal, Freya obtained the ability to transform into SYR, while Horn gained the ability to transform into Freya.</p><h3>Syr was originally the name belonging to Horn. After making a deal with the little girl, Freya obtained her name and the ability to transform into her, while Horn gained the ability to transform into Freya.</h3><h3>Why did Freya disguise as SYR?</h3><p>Syr was picked up as a child by Freya and wished to be Freya. So Freya took the identity of Syr for herself, and gave Syr (who was renamed Helun) transformation magic to become Freya. Basically, whenever we see Syr in the series, it’s actually Freya, and during those times Helun transforms and takes the place of Freya.</p><h3>Does Ryu know Syr is Freya?</h3><p>Upon finally learning Syr’s true identity as Freya, Ryu was shocked and denied that she was truly Syr when the Goddess showed an attitude unbefitting her friend’s usual one. Their relationship returned back to normal after Ryu and the rest of waitresses convinced Freya to stay in Orario as Syr following the War Game.</p><h3>Is Syr in love with Bell?</h3><p>They both are in love with him, but Ryu is still in a little bit of a denial phase and still tries to pair Bell and Syr together.</p><h3>Why is Freya so obsessed with Bell?</h3><p>On the surface, Freya simply wants Bell to become one of her prized possessions, to sit by her side as a showpiece to further her stance as Orario’s strongest. However, her desire for Bell goes far beyond the simplistic view of attaining his love, since she is primarily motivated by her destiny to find her husband.</p><h3>Is Syr really the Goddess Freya?</h3><p>Freya initially used the identity of Syr just as a disguise, a mere game of roleplay like the ones she played in Heaven. Over time, however, her attitude and feelings became more and more genuine, to the point Syr became “Freya without makeup”, a reflection of her real self.</p><h3>Who will Bell Cranel end up with?</h3><p>The author has stated Ais x Bell is endgame, so unless he changes his mind they’ll end up together.</p><h3>Who is the strongest God in DanMachi?</h3><p>The strongest God in DanMachi is Zeus, who was once the leader of the most powerful Familia in the land of man.</p><h3>Is Syr actually Freya?</h3><p>Freya initially used the identity of Syr just as a disguise, a mere game of roleplay. But over time, her attitude and feelings became more genuine, and Syr became a reflection of her real self.</p><h3>Does Freya know Bell is Zeus’ grandson?</h3><p>Freya doesn’t know. Hermes is the only one that knows that Bell is Zeus’ adoptive grandson.</p><h3>Does Freya have a crush on Bell?</h3><p>After she witnessed Bell defeat a Silverback, she confessed to him that she fell in love with him after witnessing that feat, though Bell assumed she was just teasing him. As Freya became more and more captivated by and obsessed with Bell, the time that she spent as Syr became less and less.</p><h3>Does Bell reject SYR?</h3><p>In the hostess of fertility inn, after Bell rejected Syr’s confession, Freya told Mia that Syr will stop showing up and of course, Mia had no objection since it was the order of her goddess. Unlike the waitress, who didn’t know what was going on, Mia told them that Syr will be absent for a while.</p><h3>Why is Ottar loyal to Freya?</h3><p>When Ottar was a child, he was abandoned without even having known his own name. Freya found him dying in an alley somewhere and told him he was beautiful and took him into her Familia. She also gave him his name at this time. Due to her material support and emotional warmth, Freya would become everything to Ottar.</p><h3>Is Freya jealous of AIS?</h3><p>Freya has been shown to get jealous whenever she sees Ais around Bell, such as when Ais trains Bell and when she and Bell danced at Apollo’s Ball. However, despite having told Ishtar that she will not let any other woman claim Bell, she has yet to make any attempts on Ais’ life.</p><h3>Why did Freya turn bad?</h3><p>Kratos eventually resorted to kill Baldur in order to save Freya, earning Freya’s hatred in the process. She swears vengeance against Kratos for killing Baldur, even though her son was hellbent on killing her and would have forced Kratos to kill him anyway right afterward.</p><h3>What was the necklace Syr gave Bell?</h3><p>It’s then that Syr runs up to the wagon and gives Bell a necklace with a green jewel. She claims that it’s a good luck charm from a certain adventurer.</p><h3>Why is Bell’s soul transparent?</h3><p>It was hinted that Bell’s soul is clear because of his innocence and inexperience. The slaves and Arry in episode Freya souls became gray and clouded like smoke when they were depressed or had some strong worry weighing on their mind.</p><h3>Is Bell the reincarnation of Argonaut?</h3><p>Yes, Bell is the reincarnation of Arg</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FErJpnm5%2BifKitzKKloGWgmrGqrY6wn7JllJ6xbrLRnrCaZZKasLC5xGaqsqpf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./chris-browns-baby-mama-ammika-harris-leaves-little-to-the-imagination-in-this-pink-silky-dress-see-her-recent-photo-session-400106.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title>&larr;
