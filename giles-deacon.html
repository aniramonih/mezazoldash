Giles Deacon is best known for designing the wedding dress for Pippa Middleton, sister of Catherine in 2017.</h3><h2><span id=Early_Life>Early Life</span></h2><p>Giles Deacon was born on<strong> January 10, 1969,</strong> and his hometown is Darlington, England. As of 2021, he is <strong>52 years old.</strong> Giles belongs to Caucasian Descent ethnicity and is Christian by religion. Talking about his parents, his father, David Deacon, was an agricultural salesman and his mother Judith was a homemaker. He has an elder sister.</p><p>Moving towards his educational background, Giles attended Barnard Castle School where he developed a great interest in music and started taking classes. He was also interested in marine biology but dropped the idea of studying it. After completion of schooling, he joined Harrogate College of Arts just because of a vacant seat. While studying, he found interest in fashion designing for which he joined Central Saint Martin in London.</p><h2><span id=Professional_Life_and_Career>Professional Life and Career</span></h2><p>In 1992, Giles began collaborating with his friend to establish their own label “Doran Deacon”. But he moved to Paris that year and started working for Jean-Charles and learned how to commercially use the brand name from him.</p><p>After returning to London in 1994, he started working as a freelance. Shortly, he joined the Italian leather goods company Bottega Veneta as its head designer after his friend Katie Grand recommended him. He worked for 3 years with it. In 2000, Giles created his first collection under the brand name of BV which attracted the Gucci group and acquired Bottega Veneta in 2001.</p><p>The new management of Bottega Veneta didn’t renew Giles’ contract but he was hired by Gucci’s creative director, Tom Ford. After working for one season, he returned to London because he fell ill due to an infection.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-112654 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographymask.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Giles-Deacon-and-his-character-illustration.jpg alt="Giles Deacon" width=650 height=812 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-112654 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Giles Deacon and his character illustration (Source: Instagram)</p><h4>Giles Deacon’s Own Label</h4><p>While being treated in London, Giles thought of starting his own label, “Giles”. Giles took a bank loan and also used his entire savings to create his first collection which was presented at the London Fashion Week in February 2004. Similarly, in 2005, he refused the offer of the top job at Givenchy because he would have to abandon his own label for that. Rather, he continued taking part in London Fashion week under his own label.</p><p>The year 2006 was a turning point for him as he was able to establish his label fully. He began to have big names such as Scarlett Johansson, Thandie Newton, Princess Beatrice, and Kerry Washington as his clients. In the following year, he collaborated with the High Street fashion chain, New Look, and presented “Gold by Giles” and also “Mulberry for Giles” with the British Fashion Company. He joined French fashion house, Ungaro, as their creative director and presented his first collection for this company which gained high praise.</p><p>In 2011, his debut to television was made as he appeared as a judge on “Britain’s Next Top Model”. Similarly, in the same year, he participated in “New Look Style the Nation”. Moreover, in 2016, he launched his first haute couture collection. After that, he has been designing gorgeous dresses for different celebrity clients like Victoria Beckham and Drew Barrymore.</p><h2><span id=Net_Worth_and_Achievements>Net Worth and Achievements</span></h2><p>Giles has earned a huge amount of money through his career in fashion designing.
