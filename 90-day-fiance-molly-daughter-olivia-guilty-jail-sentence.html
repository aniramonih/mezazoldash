According to legal documents viewed by </span><i><span>In Touch</span></i><span> at the time, Olivia failed to enter a family violence treatment program, failed to take two drug tests in March and failed the drug test she did take. At the time of her arrest, she also tested positive for fentanyl by consumption.</span></p><p><span>Olivia was sentenced to probation following a domestic violence incident that happened between <a href=#>her and her mom</a> in October 2020. </span><i><span>In Touch</span></i><span> previously confirmed that Olivia was charged with misdemeanor simple battery after she and Molly had a dispute that turned physical at Molly’s home in Woodstock, Georgia.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/90-Day-Fiance-Molly-Hopkins-Daughter-Olivia-Arrested-2.jpg><p><span>“[Olivia] allegedly struck the victim [Molly] multiple times in the head leaving a clearly visible red mark and kicked the victim in the leg,” the affidavit for the arrest read. “A third party witnessed the entire altercation.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Following the altercation, Olivia was penalized with 40 hours of community service, a $500 fine, family violence and anger management classes, no drugs or alcohol and no violent contact with Molly.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Her jail time sentence comes nearly one month after </span><i><span>In Touch</span></i><span> exclusively confirmed that the <a href=#>aggravated assault and battery case</a> involving her and her mom’s now ex-boyfriend, </span><a href=#><b>Kelly Brown</b></a><span>, is still <a href=#>open</a>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“The case is still technically labeled active because it has not been approved by a supervisor yet,” Cobb County Police Department’s Detective Lincoln exclusively told </span><i><span>In Touch </span></i><span>in a statement on March 23. “Once it is approved it will be labeled inactive.”</span></p><p><i><span>In Touch</span></i><span> previously broke the news of the </span><a href=#><i><span>90 Day: The Single Life </span></i></a><span>couple’s split after nearly two years of dating on February 4. Prior to Molly and Kelly’s split, </span><i><span>In Touch </span></i><span>exclusively learned that Olivia and Kelly were allegedly involved in a physical altercation at <a href=#>Molly’s place of business</a>, LiviRae Lingerie, according to an obtained police report filed on February 2.</span></p><p><span>Olivia claimed she was working behind the counter with her mother and another employee when Kelly walked into the store.</span></p><p><span>“Kelly was angry with Olivia because of problems with Olivia’s boyfriend. Olivia and Kelly both argued with each other. Kelly stated that he would come at her,” the reporting officer detailed. “Olivia said to come at her then. At which point, Kelly rushed to the counter, grabbed Olivia by her neck and slammed her against the wall.”</span></p><p><span>“Olivia stated that she waited a long time to report the incident because she did not want to stress her mouth during that time and because Kelly is a former NYPD detective,” the report continued.</span></p><p><span>In the report, Olivia recounted that she was unable to obtain security footage as Molly’s <a href=#>former best friend</a> and business partner, </span><a href=#><b>Cynthia Decker</b></a><span>, was the only one with “access to the footage.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Six days later, <a href=#>Cynthia spoke out</a> in an exclusive statement to</span><i><span> In Touch </span></i><span>and insisted she had <a href=#>nothing to do</a> with the situation.</span></p><p><span>“I am deeply mortified and want my name to be removed from the report. I will be telling investigators all of this as I do not want to be listed anywhere on this!” the</span><a href=#><i><span> 90 Day: Pillow Talk </span></i></a><span>alum on February 8. “I have tried to remain quiet and let this play out but now they are involving me, and I am not going to sit back as my name gets misconstrued.”</span></p><p><span><a href=#>Kelly later broke his silence</a> on February 15, calling the altercation an “an unfortunate verbal incident.”</span></p><p><span>“We all as a family expected to remain private,” Kelly said in an exclusive statement to</span><i><span> In Touch</span></i><span> on February 15. “It is disappointing that Olivia chooses to make the incident public three months later. Although the timing is interesting, I wish Molly and her daughters all the best and I’m grateful that I’m moving on with my life.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTqKycoKeasqy42GeaqKVfpby0wNJocGlllJbGbrLImqWcnV2ivK242Gabmq2XncGmvoyoo6KumZZ6qMHIpauyZZqWtq150p6lrZ2emLJw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./10-best-documentary-directors-of-all-time.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Best Documentary Directors Of All Time">&larr;
