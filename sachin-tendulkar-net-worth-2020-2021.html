Well, if you’re ready, let’s start.</p><h2>Early Life</h2><p>Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar was born on April 24, 1973, in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. He is known by many nicknames like the God of Cricket, Little Master, and Master Blaster. His father, Ramesh Tendulkar, was a famous Marathi Novelist, and his mother, Rajni Tendulkar, worked in the Insurance industry. Sachin has three elder siblings; all three of them are from his father’s previous marriage.</p><p>As a young boy, Sachin was a very naughty boy and a bully. Every single day, he got into a fight with the neighboring boys. It was his elder brother who encouraged him to play cricket to divert his mind from the fights. His brother Ajit enrolled him in the cricket academy. The cricket academy belonged to a famous Indian coach, Ramakant Achrekar.</p><p>It was Ramakant Achrekar who advised Sachin to go to Sharadashram Vidyamandir High School, as the school had a very rich tradition of cricket. Soon he started playing for the school and started winning games for them.

Together they played for their school and ultimately for the Indian team. While in the school, Sachin and Vinod were involved in a record 664 runs partnership in an inter-school match against St. Xavier High School.</p><h2>Personal life</h2><p>Sachin is married to Dr. Anjali Mehta, who is a pediatrician and six years older to him.
