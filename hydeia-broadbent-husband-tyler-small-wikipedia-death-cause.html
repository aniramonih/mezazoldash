Her father, Loren Broadbent, confirmed the death. No reason was given.&nbsp;</p><p>Talking about her personal life, Hydeia Broadbent was married to her husband Tyler Small. Today we’re gonna discuss who is Hydeia Broadbent’s husband Tyler Small.

Tyler doesn’t have his official wikipedia age.</p><p>On the other hand, Hydeia Broadbent was born on June 14, 1984, in Las Vegas, Nevada. Her birth mother abandoned her at the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada soon after her birth. Loren and Patricia Broadbent cared for her as a foster child before adopting her.</p><p>When Hydeia was three years old, the hospital notified the Broadbents that her biological mother had given birth to another child at the same facility and abandoned him as well. The mother and kid tested positive for HIV. The hospital recommended that Hydeia also be tested for the virus. The results indicated that she was also HIV positive.</p><h2><strong>Hydeia Broadbent </strong><strong>and Tyler Small </strong><strong>Married Life?</strong></h2><p>Regarding her relationship, some reports claim Hydeia Broadbent was in multiple relationships in her adolescence. <span>Aside from that, today we’ll discuss her personal life, Hydeis Broadbent’s spouse, and family.</span></p><p><span>So, her family and loved ones planned a tiny ceremony, made lifelong pals, and married Tyler Tiny, a childhood buddy. Hydeia Broadbent prefers seclusion, therefore little information about her love life is available.</span></p><p>The “Friends for Life” campaign is a tradition and symbolic gesture of support and friendship in the HIV/AIDS community.

Let it be known that she has never publicly declared her gender and may not have felt comfortable doing so. It would be wonderful to respect her decision not to share her personal information with the world and leave it at that.</p><h2><strong>Hydeia Broadbent Illness</strong></h2><p>Hydeia’s life was more difficult than that of most Americans since she was infected at birth and diagnosed with AIDS when she was just three years old. AIDS may not pose a higher threat in 2024, but it was a major issue in 1984. Her parents abandoned her in the hospital, and Loren and Patricia Broadbent adopted her.</p><p>Hydeia was also one of the first children to publicly discuss her diagnosis and experience with AIDS. Hydeia Broadbent was infected with the virus and thus never married or had a husband.&nbsp; However, at the age of nine, she held a “Friends for Life” ceremony and exchanged vows with Tyler Small, another young HIV patient.</p><h2><strong>Hydeia Broadbent Cause Of Death</strong></h2><p>Hydeia Broadbent died on February 20, 2024, at the age of 39, from organ failure.

She was one of the first children to speak publicly about her experience with the virus, challenging the preconceptions and myths around it. She inspired and empowered millions of people worldwide with her message of hope, resilience, and compassion. She also helped to expand HIV/AIDS research and treatment, particularly among children and minorities.</p><h2><strong>How Old Is Tyler Small?
