He was already entangled in the situation caused by Twitter user Jovi Pena, when his recent comment on women during his Twitch livestream, drew him more flak.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Kai Cenat </strong></a>was hosting an online date between a couple when the woman was facing some technical issues on her side when she joined the Discord call. As the streamer asked her to speak up, he accentuated his voice after getting no response. This continued for a while when he was interrupted by another member who was on the call.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-block-embed-embed-handler wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Apparently the member was shocked to hear the loud voice adopted by Kai Cenat. The streamer later explained his behavior by saying, “Bro, sometimes girls like the aggressive sh*t, bro. So I went with an aggressive approach”. This particular comment caught a lot of attention, especially when it came just after a few weeks when Jovi Penna revealed getting assaulted at the content creator’s party.</p><p>Even though Cenat took a quick action on the controversy by revealing that he went straight to the police, some recent discoveries by the community are leaving second thoughts in the mind of his fans. One of those discoveries were <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Jovi Penna accusing him </strong></a>of not cooperating with the police properly.

She even showed some text exchanges between her and Cenat, which indicated that the streamer was denying that he knew the perpetrator.</p><p>However, it was later found out, that the accused and Kai Cenat were school friends as they even posted a picture together on Instagram. As the community started demanding for answers, the Twitch star stated that he is waiting for the<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> <strong>results of police investigation</strong></a>. A couple of weeks has passed since, but an acute result is yet to be published.</p><p>Amidst that, Cenat on his recent livestream was found joking about the situation along with fellow streamer<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> <strong>YourRage</strong></a>. The latter content creator exclaimed how Kai was forcing him to get drunk, “you know the last time people got drunk”, an alleged reference to the streamer’s New Year party.</p><p>While Kai had quickly hung up the call after understanding the context, the clip didn’t go well with his community as they started criticizing him for joking about such a sensitive situation.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Reddit_reactions></span><strong>Reddit reactions </strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Both of the clips paved their way to r/livestreamfails, and as an obvious fact, users didn’t miss their chance to lash out at the streamer.
