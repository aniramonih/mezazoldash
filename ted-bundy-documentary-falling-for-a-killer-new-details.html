But one person has remained noticeably mum through it all: Bundy's ex-girlfriend Elizabeth Kendall (a pseudonym), who reported him to the police but was turned away. For the first time in 40 years, Elizabeth and her daughter, Molly, are speaking out in Ted Bundy: Falling for a Killer, now available on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/Ted-Bundy-Falling-Killer-Season/dp/B082FPGQD8 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Amazon Prime Video" class="body-link css-d2yypp et3p2gv0">Amazon Prime Video</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">The five-part docuseries focuses on the perspectives of Elizabeth and Molly, who open up about their most intimate experiences with Bundy on their own terms. "This story has been told many times by men," Elizabeth said in the Falling for a Killer trailer. "Now's the time to talk about our own story from beginning to end, because we lived and so many people didn't."<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Here are the biggest revelations from Falling for a Killer.<br></p><img alt="Face, Hair, Blond, Eyebrow, Hairstyle, Nose, Skin, Chin, Head, Lip, " title="Face, Hair, Blond, Eyebrow, Hairstyle, Nose, Skin, Chin, Head, Lip, " width=4976 height=2800 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/tedbundy-elizabeth-1580492385.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-wudbrp e6iqukd2">Courtesy Amazon Studios</span><p>Elizabeth Kendall today.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h3 css-k16obj et3p2gv0">Elizabeth hasn't loved anyone the way she loved Bundy.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">They met at a Seattle bar in 1969. Elizabeth, a single mother, was new in town. Bundy was sitting by himself at a table, and asked her to dance. She was flattered, she said in Falling for a Killer, because he was "funny, mature, polished." They went home together that night. The next morning, Bundy fixed her daughter, Molly, breakfast. "I’ve not had that with anyone else, just right off the bat where I felt connected with someone," Elizabeth says. "It felt like two pieces of a puzzle coming together. It just fit. It was quite spectacular."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">It wasn't long before she fell in love. Together, they taught Molly how to ride a bike. They read her books at night and went out to eat. They became a family. "He settled right in. I was hooked," Elizabeth says. "I felt loved, I didn't have any doubts."</p><h6 class="css-e6lzgm e6pr2lz3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e6pr2lz1">Read Next</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h3 css-k16obj et3p2gv0">Bundy played naked hide-and-go-seek with Molly.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Molly says looking back, there were signs something was wrong. Like when he "hid under a blanket and I came out and pulled it off, and he’s naked. And I say in shock, 'You’re naked!'" Molly says in Falling for a Killer. "He says, 'Well, yeah, I can turn invisible but my clothes can’t and I didn’t want you to see me.'" She didn't tell anyone about the incident until much later. It was strange of course, but what did it mean? Molly says she still doesn't know, only that it made her feel uncomfortable.<br></p><img alt="Hair, Face, Blond, Head, Eyebrow, Beauty, Chin, Lip, Nose, Hairstyle, " title="Hair, Face, Blond, Head, Eyebrow, Beauty, Chin, Lip, Nose, Hairstyle, " width=4876 height=2732 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/tedbundy-molly-1580492453.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-wudbrp e6iqukd2">Amazon Studios</span><p>Molly Kendall today.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h3 css-k16obj et3p2gv0">Bundy’s first known victim speaks out for the first time in the documentary.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Elizabeth first noticed Bundy acting "differently" in early 1974—the year of his first known attempt at murder. University of Washington student Karen Sparks was in her room when Bundy busted in, took the bed frame off her bed, and smashed her skull. He used a metal rod from the frame to sexually assault her, leaving her bladder split in half. She lay there bleeding for 20 hours, until a roommate found her. Speaking out for the first time in Falling for a Killer, Sparks said she was permanently brain damaged and lost 50 percent of her hearing and 40 percent of her vision. "I have terrible ringing in my ears, it's just constant," she says. "I had epileptic fits. Luckily I was able to overcome those."</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h3 css-k16obj et3p2gv0">After the Sammamish State Park murders, Bundy took Elizabeth out for hamburgers.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">In 1974, Bundy used his old Volkswagen to abduct two women at Lake Sammamish State Park. Shortly after he murdered them, he picked up Elizabeth and took her out on a date. They went to a bowling alley and ate hamburgers. Elizabeth recalls in Falling for a Killer that his eyes appeared "really close together" and looked "weird."</p><img alt="Ted Bundy In Police Station" title="Ted Bundy In Police Station" width=2802 height=2447 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/suspected-murderer-theodore-bundy-leans-on-the-leon-county-news-photo-1580493482.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-wudbrp e6iqukd2">Bettmann</span><span class="css-efig6y e6iqukd0">//</span><span class="css-wudbrp e6iqukd1">Getty Images</span><p>Bundy at his trial.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h3 css-k16obj et3p2gv0">Elizabeth warned the police about Bundy several times. She also confided in her dad.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">When Elizabeth saw a police sketch of the Sammamish perpetrator in the newspaper, she froze. “It looked like my Ted," she says in Falling for a Killer. "I just tried to brush it off, but I was really gripped by fear, like, there’s something wrong here. I looked at it over and over and over again. When I got home, I started going through my photo albums and pulled out a picture of Ted that looked very similar.” She anonymously called a tip line and asked whether he wore a watch on his right arm and if he drove a brown Volkswagen. The officer told her the perp's vehicle was bronze. "I said, 'Whew, that’s not my Ted then!' That night I went to Ted's house and we lay on his floor and talked, and he was just Ted," she says in the doc. "I felt crazy, like why would I even think this? I’d had four years with this man. I knew he wasn’t capable of doing these things. Turns out he was."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">When a string of murders happened in Utah, where Bundy was accepted into law school, Elizabeth became suspicious again. "I couldn’t let it go,” she says. “It scared me out of my wits.” Again, she called Seattle detectives. They seemed, she says, disinterested. When Elizabeth confided in her father, he also brushed off her concern. “My dad completely discounted what I was thinking,” she says. “He so liked Ted, as we all did. I feel in hindsight that he chose Ted and not his daughter.”</p><img alt="Horse, Bridle, Rein, Snapshot, Painting, Working animal, Horse trainer, Rural area, Recreation, Landscape, " title="Horse, Bridle, Rein, Snapshot, Painting, Working animal, Horse trainer, Rural area, Recreation, Landscape, " width=1400 height=1380 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2020-01-31-at-1-31-31-pm-1580495500.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-wudbrp e6iqukd2">Courtesy Amazon Studios</span><p>Elizabeth and Molly with Bundy.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="body-h3 css-k16obj et3p2gv0">Bundy told Elizabeth he was “sick.”</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">After Bundy was taken into custody, he called Elizabeth and told her he had a sickness. "He told me that he knew now there was something he couldn’t be around," Elizabeth says in Falling for a Killer. "And when I asked him what that was, he said 'Don’t make me say it.' So, I knew he was meaning young beautiful woman. He was just addicted to killing. And he started to tell me about this 'force,' is what he called it. He said it just started building within him and it would take days before he acted out but once he acted out it was just over."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Bundy told Elizabeth that he remembered taking her out for hamburgers after abducting the women from Sammamish park. "He said... 'It’s not like I had a black out,'" Elizabeth says. "I was just shocked, because I thought if he did do these things he had to have two different personalities, but he was just telling me it was just him.”</p><img alt="People, Fun, Family, Smile, " title="People, Fun, Family, Smile, " width=1125 height=1018 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/tb-s210s-img027-2-081419-1580495347.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-wudbrp e6iqukd2">Courtesy Amazon Studios</span><p>Bundy with Elizabeth and Molly.</p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="body-h3 css-k16obj et3p2gv0">Molly watched Bundy's trial on television.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">She was staying with her grandparents for the summer when Bundy went on trial. Every morning she woke up and watched it on television. “That was the moment for me where my whole world shifted and I saw him as something entirely different,” she says in Falling for a Killer. “It was really so shattering to see these murdered women, to see the evidence that depicted their smashed heads and hear about the physical things that were inflicted upon them and see the evidence as such. It was horrendous. It’s just like, where do you get disbelief, at that point? I couldn’t find it."</p><img alt="Hair, Hairstyle, Fun, Smile, Long hair, Photography, Child, " title="Hair, Hairstyle, Fun, Smile, Long hair, Photography, Child, " width=1097 height=1117 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/tb-s210s-img059-2-3-1-081419-1580495412.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-wudbrp e6iqukd2">Courtesy Amazon Studios</span><p>Bundy with Molly.</p><h2 data-node-id=30 class="body-h3 css-k16obj et3p2gv0">Elizabeth and Molly both struggled with alcoholism.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Elizabeth started drinking to “shut her mind up,” she says in Falling for a Killer. Molly also struggled with addiction. "I tried to drink myself to death," she says. "I drank till I would fall asleep…so I could be done [with Bundy].”</p><h2 data-node-id=32 class="body-h3 css-k16obj et3p2gv0">Elizabeth kept a scrapbook of their family photos.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">After Bundy was sentenced to death and electrocuted in Raiford, Florida in 1989, Elizabeth kept many of their photos together. "To know he was killing people while we were still in a relationship is still really a hard idea to incorporate to integrate into my life. That fact invalidates what we had," she says in Falling for a Killer. "It seemed like nothing was real between him and my daughter.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7prjLnmWcp51ksLa4066pnmedpMOqsdJmq69nkWh9d4WQcnBuZ6SasW6u1KebsmWUpLC2ucSnq5qqqWKzorjLoqWgZZakv26tjKSgpaSVp3qvsdZmm56skZ65tHs%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./thandie-newton-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Thandie Newton Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">&larr;
