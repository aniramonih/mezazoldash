Jay Leno, who has a net worth over <strong>$400 million,</strong> is known for hosting web and television series, <i>'Jay Leno's Garage.' </i>Leno is known to have a profound love for automobiles. His cars and bikes collections include hundreds of classic turbine and electric vehicles.</p><p>Jay Leno was born <i>April 28, 1950,</i> in New Rochelle, New York. His father, <strong>Angelo</strong>, was a New York-born salesman. His mother, <strong>Catherine,</strong> who grew in Greenock, Scotland, moved to New York at the age of 11. Jay graduated from Andover High School and received a Bachelor of speech therapy degree from Emerson College.</p><p>Besides, Jay felt education was a challenge as he had dyslexia, at the time a little-recognized intellectual disorder. During those times, a school guidance advisor personally suggested that he should&nbsp;drop out of school, but he did not, and the rest is history.</p><h2>Jay Leno's Wife</h2><p>One of the successful late-night hosts, Jay Leno, is happily married to <strong>Mavis Leno</strong>, his longtime wife for 39 years. The couple first met in the 1970s. Jay and his wife exchanged their wedding vows on <i>November 3, 1980</i>. Their wedding ceremony was small and private, which they had organized at a friend's house. Do you know Leno's parents were also married on <i>November 3?</i></p><p>Furthermore, Jay's wife Mavis is an American philanthropist, feminist, and wife of Jay Leno, the former host of The Tonight Show. Besides, so far, the longtime marital couple is not engaged in any sort of rumors regarding their divorce.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/3/15/nkcbvid-1584273086483.PNG><p>Their marriage is not only deemed good in comparison to Hollywood, and their relationship is an indication of real engagement and contentment for any couple.</p><h2>Do Jay and his spouse share any kids?&nbsp;</h2><p>It's almost been a 40 year of their union, but they still don't have any children. The longtime couples have publicly said that not having a child was their sole choice. This was a compromise that Jay had already made before he approached Leno.</p><p>They have wholeheartedly supported the judgment of not having a kid. Nevertheless, when speaking with The Washington Post in 2014, his spouse Mavis explained how she used to watch The Honeymooners as a kid of the 1950s comedy, and how the series had a life-long impact on her perceptions of marriage.</p><h2>Tragic Story Jay's Life</h2><p>The 68 years old comedian-actor Jay has seen many ups and downs throughout his life. He is one of the most influential personalities of Hollywood who tries to cover his struggle under the shadow of his lavish lifestyle.</p><p>While he was doing the first season as host of The Tonight Show, unfortunately, his mother died at the age of 82, and his father also died at the age of 84 in the following year. It must be hard for jay to deal with his loss. But somehow, he moved on his life from that tragic event.&nbsp;</p><p>Later on, &nbsp;in 2002, his older brother <strong>Patrick Leno</strong>, who was a Vietnamese soldier and graduate of the Yale Law School, died at the age of 62 from cancer complications.</p><h2>One of the most successful Comedians</h2><p>No doubt, Jay Leno is one of the richest comedians in Hollywood. Through his public speaking skill and the extraordinary persona, he has earned an enormous amount of wealth and fame through his profession. It estimated that his net wealth is staggering <strong>$400 million</strong> as per 2020. Another successful comedian who has a similar net worth is <strong>Larry David,</strong> who reportedly gave half of his fortune to ex-wife, <a href=#><strong>Laurie David</strong></a>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/3/15/dnm%20veb-1584273387888.PNG><p>His late-night show is considered one of the most successful shows in T.V industry. Jay Leno allegedly <a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>received</strong></a> a <strong>$30 million</strong> salary at the height of his tenure hosting NBC's "The Tonight Show."</p><p>Furthermore, when he took a 50% &nbsp;pay cut in 2012, it compensates his around <strong>$15 million</strong>. Similarly, Jay receives about <strong>$10 million</strong> in 2011 from a hectic stand-up performing schedule that involves more than 200 shows a year.</p><h2>Analysis Of Jay Leno's Assets</h2><p>Leno maintains two properties on opposite coastlines: one in Beverly Hills, California, and one in Newport, R.I. He and his wife acquired the <strong>$13.5 million</strong> Newport oceanfront estate in 2017. Many successful comedians and hosts such as <a href=#><strong>Martin Lawrence</strong></a> spend their money on luxurious assets.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/3/15/zhbfie-1584273509523.PNG><p>Moreover, Leno's main house is 15,851 square feet, which is perched on a beautifully groomed nine-acre estate. It includes a private beach, lake, tennis court, carriage house, and gardens.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/3/15/dkjedbhciye-1584273582196.PNG><p>Evidently, his home consists of a six-car workshop for Leno's favorite cars. An artist initially designed the home in 1936, who was renowned for his work on the Statue of Liberty reconstruction.</p><h2>Jay Leno Cars and Motorbikes Collection</h2><p>Leno has earned an enormous amount of wealth, and it is obvious that he is spending a portion of his money lavishly. Jay has a deep love for antique automobiles. He is reported to own a total of 286 automobiles, comprising 169 cars and 117 motorcycles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/3/15/bjgvtuu-1584273631401.PNG><p>His love and passion of cars and bike is outstanding. He has almost spent<strong> $100 million</strong> on his cars and motorcycles. Some of his collections include two Double steam cars operated by Howard Hughes, the famous 1963 Jaguar XK-E, and some new electric vehicles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/3/15/dvdscacacs-1584273844494.PNG><p>He returned many of the cars to their former glory and also took model cars and found ways to get them fit for the track. The bulk of Leno's array is actually located in his vast, hangar-like workshop in Burbank, California.</p><h2>Charity And Donation&nbsp;</h2><p>In 2001, he and his wife contributed <strong>$100,000</strong> to the movement to combat gender discrimination in Afghanistan through the Feminist Majority Foundation to teach the world about the condition of women under Taliban control in Afghanistan.</p><p>Similarly, In 2009, in memory of Lennie Sogoloff, who founded Leno at his jazz club, Lennie's-on - the-Turnpike, he contributed <strong>$100,000</strong> to a scholarship program at Salem State College (now Salem State University).</p><p>Besides, Leno auctioned his Fiat 500 in August 2012, which was offered for <strong>$385,000</strong> with all the money going to a organization that helps the injured combat veterans survive by offering emergency homes for them.</p><p><strong>Stay Tuned With Us: </strong><a href=#><strong>MarriedCeleb </strong></a><strong>To Know More About Hollywood Actors.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqOYsmWcmruw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./nicky-jam-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="  Nicky Jams net worth explored  from Puerto Rico to international music career of Netflix sta">&larr;
