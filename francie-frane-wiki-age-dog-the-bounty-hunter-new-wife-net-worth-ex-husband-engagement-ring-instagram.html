His former wife, Beth Chapman, who was diagnosed with stage II throat cancer in 2017, died at the age of 51 in June 2019 after a battle with cancer. Francie lost her husband, Bob, to cancer before Beth Chapman died. The couple met after Dog called Francie’s husband Bob to do some yard work at his house in Colorado. Sadly Francie had to break the news to Dog that Bob had died several months before his wife, Beth. The pair began talking on the phone and became close – and are helping each other deal with the grief of losing their spouses</p><p>“We hooked up on the phone and started talking to each other, crying and consoling each other. And then one thing led to another,” the reality star said in May 2020. “It’s just incredible that I’ve been able to meet someone like her.”</p><p>Dog’s daughter, Lyssa Chapman, told The Sun: “They are both so happy together and they are good for each other. Francie has been very respectful to all the kids – and to Beth’s memory – and my dad is the same way with Bob and their children. They go to church three times a week and dad is trying to give up smoking – she is a good woman for my dad. He’s the happiest I’ve seen him in a long time – he’s so in love and wants to spend the rest of his life with Francie. They are both lost their spouses to cancer so they know what i’s like to go through that and they are helping each other through it. But at the same time they are being very respectful of each other’s grieving process and they’re not trying to replace each other’s partner. Beth would approve – I honestly believe that Beth sent Francie for my dad – I feel like Beth and Bob are up there watching down over them.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=dog-the-bounty-hunter-new-wife-francie-frane></span> Dog The Bounty Hunter New Wife Francie Frane<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Duane “Dog The Bounty Hunter” Chapman and Francie Frane will tie the knot on Sept. 2, 2021. The reality television star shared that he’s getting married during an episode of the “Two Guys From Hollywood” podcast, on August 10, 2021. “I’m getting married. We went to the venue, picked it out yesterday, looked at it,” Chapman said. “Man, it costs a lot to get married.”</p><p>“I felt very bad about even wanting to have someone else after Beth,” the “Dog the Bounty Hunter” star said during the podcast. “When I went to look in the bible in Genesis and found out how Adam got Eve as I was going to find the exact story I saw the scripture that said God does not want a man to be alone. That he knows we need a companion, whether we’re man or woman.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=dog-the-bounty-hunter-engaged-to-francie-frane></span> Dog The Bounty Hunter Engaged to Francie Frane<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Duane “Dog The Bounty Hunter” Chapman got engaged to Francie Frane in May 2020, 11 months after his wife Beth Chapman died of cancer. Francie told The Sun when sharing the news of their engagement: “I think I had gone to pick up some food, and then when I came back, he had all the lights turned down with just a few lights on and a bunch of candles lit. So when I came in, I was like, ‘Wow, this is awesome.’ Then he said, ‘Come in, sit down because I need to talk to you. I know that God brought you into my life, and I don’t want to spend one moment of it without you. ‘He said, ‘Will you marry me and spend the rest of our lives together?’ Who can say no to that? It was wonderful.”</p><p>Following news of their engagement, the television personality opened up in May 2020 about how the couple’s bond began. “For a living, [Francie’s] a rancher and she recently lost her husband to cancer six months before I lost Beth. So we hopped on the phone, started talking to each other, crying and consoling each other, and then one thing led to another and it’s just incredible that I’ve been able to meet someone like her,” he shared at the time. “With Francie, I’m allowed to speak about Beth, we speak about her husband. We cry. We hold each other.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=francie-frane-age></span> Francie Frane Age<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Francie Frane is 52 years old.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=francie-frane-late-husband></span> Francie Frane Late Husband<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Francie Frane lost her husband, Bob Frane, to cancer in 2018.
