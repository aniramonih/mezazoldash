Who is she? Is she married? Who is her husband? What about her net worth? The answer is revealed in this article.</p><h3><span id=Korto_Momolu_on_Project_Runway_All-Star_Season_20>Korto Momolu on Project Runway All-Star Season 20</span></h3><p>Project Runway premiered its 20th season in June 2023. She previously appeared in Season 5 of the show and is now competing again in hopes of securing the top prize and the title this season.</p><p>It was the very first episode of the show she watched that led her to compete in one herself. She told Alle: “I was hooked. I knew I was meant to be on the show.”</p><p>In addition to winning the show, season 20 also became an opportunity for her to “present her work to a new audience and era of fashion/Project runway fans.” For her, celebrating the 20th season “was truly a gift and a blessing to be included in the top 14 with some of my all-time Project runway favorites.”</p><p>For her, this season was all about work. She added, “Win or lose, it was about representing my ‘girl’, Kulture, the rest being true to my aesthetic and always presenting myself as real and authentic as possible.”</p><h3><span id=How_much_is_Korto_Momolu_net_worth>How much is Korto Momolu net worth?</span></h3><p>Korto Momolu has a net worth of under $1.5 million. Her passion for design started with a Barbie doll she got when she was 10 years old. Korto stated, “After a few cuts and stitches, I got my first collection.” However, it wasn’t until the 11th grade that her interest in fashion shifted from art to fashion design.</p><p>Korto is a native of Ottawa, Ontario and graduated from L’Academies des Couturiers [he moved to Canada in 1990 after the coup in Liberia]. In 2006, Korto founded her own collection, working as an independent fashion designer. She expanded her professional network by applying to and being accepted into the fifth season of Bravo TV’s Project Runway.</p><p>Audiences responded positively to Korto’s key signature fusion of color and variety in style and presentation throughout the season, along with her open energy. In the end, this earned her the title of “fan’s favorite”, and at the end of the season, the position of first runner-up.</p><p>The Korto Momolu brand has grown over the years to include designing uniforms for the Walton Family Museum (Crystal Bridges), producing an eco-friendly jewelry line for the Smithsonian Museum Stores, designing a line of fashion accessories for Dillard’s Incorporated department stores, acting as an ambassador for Cheerios for Shoprite Partners in Caring campaign “Knock Out Hunger” and lending their time and expertise to countless charitable and philanthropic endeavors.</p><p>Korto debuted during the SS2009 season at New York Fashion Week as one of the “Top 5 Designers to Watch” and has since been featured in several national and international newspapers and numerous television programs. Cannabis industry organization Women Grow and Korto collaborated in the fall of 2019 to promote female leadership in the sector.</p><p>The Korto Momolu for Women Grow line was created and shown at NYFW for the SS20 shows. The product range featured eco-friendly materials including hemp and cork.</p><p>According to LinkedIn, Korto works in the role of Creative Design Director at Korto Momolu Originals.

He said: “I wanted to make clothes for the girl who was always forgotten. Honestly, it was for me and women who looked like me. I had to make clothes that included me and my body type and my culture. It was supposed to reflect what I now call my “Rah Rah Rah.” The essence of Korto.”</p><p>Alyse is a graduate of the class of 2022.
