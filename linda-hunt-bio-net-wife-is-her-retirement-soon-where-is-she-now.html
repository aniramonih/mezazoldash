hasn’t been in any recent productions.</span></p><p>Hunt was involved in a car accident in the summer of 2018 but did not sustain serious injuries.&nbsp;This traumatic experience caused the actress, who plays the role of Henrietta “Hetty” Lange, to take a short break after filming the CBS drama.</p><p><span>Many wondered if Linda Hunt’s rest would be a retirement from the screen.&nbsp;But she
