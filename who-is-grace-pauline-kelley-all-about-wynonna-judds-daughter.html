Her star sign is Gemini and at the time of her birth, she was reported to have weighed 9 lbs 4 oz.</p><p>While growing up, Grace was quite strong-headed and often liked to do what she was asked not to do. She appeared to have her own mind and was a very strong-willed child. She was also very extroverted and like sorts according to reports.</p><p>It is not clear what schools Grace Pauline Kelley attended while growing up as details about this part of her life have remained beyond reach so far. What is clear is that Grace grew up in luxury. We know this because, at the time she was born in 1996, her mother was already a wealthy and established musician who was already winning prestigious awards for her work at the time.</p><p>This means that Grace was born with a silver spoon and had all she could ever ask for at her beck and call.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/06/Grace-P1.jpg><h3><strong>Grace Pauline Kelley’s Mother and Grandmother Are Among The World’s Most Recognized Country Singers</strong></h3><p>Clearly, Grace Pauline Kelley was born into fame. Both her mother, Wynonna Judd, and grandmother, Naomi Judd are very famous for their work as country singers, although her mother, Wynonna is more recognized. Grace’s mother, Wynonna has established herself as one of the most renowned and decorated female artists in the country music genre. With an impressive track record, Wynonna has achieved 19 No. 1 singles throughout her career.</p><p>Wynonna first rose to prominence in the 1980s alongside her mother, Naomi, when they formed the beloved country music duo called The Judds. Together, they released seven albums under the Curb Records label and produced 26 singles, with an impressive 14 of them reaching No. 1 on the charts. However, after some time, The Judds disbanded when Naomi was diagnosed with hepatitis. Following this, Wynonna embarked on a solo career.</p><p>In her solo career, Wynonna has released eight studio albums, a live album, a holiday album, and two compilation albums, accompanied by over 20 singles. Her initial solo singles, “She Is His Only Need,” “I Saw the Light,” and “No One Else on Earth,” consecutively topped the U.S. country singles charts. In 1996, her fourth number-one and top-ten hit, “To Be Loved by You,” further solidified her success. Three of her albums have received platinum or higher certifications from the RIAA.</p><p>Wynonna has solidified her status as one of the best-selling country artists of all time. Her solo albums and singles bear her single name, Wynonna.&nbsp;In recognition of their exceptional contributions to country music, Wynonna and her mother, Naomi were honored in 2022 with induction into the prestigious Country Music Hall of Fame as The Judds.</p><h3><strong>Who Is Grace Pauline Kelley’s Father?</strong></h3><p>Grace Pauline Kelley’s father is a man called Arch Kelley III. Not much is known about his background except that he was born on March 23, 1931, in the town of Dickson, Tennessee. He lived a very private life, completely void of any widespread publicity until he married Grace’s mother, Wynonna.</p><p>According to reports, Arch is now a businessman. However, details about the kind of business he does are not available. But some reports say he is doing quite well for himself through his entrepreneurial pursuits. Eventually, his union with Wynonna Judd introduced him to a world of widespread recognition and fame.</p><h3><strong>Grace Pauline Kelley’s Parents Divorced When She was 2 Years Old</strong></h3><p>According to our findings, Grace Pauline Kelley’s parents, Wynonna Judd and Arch Kelley III, first met each other in 1993 and soon started dating. In December of the following year, the couple welcomed their first child, Elijah Judd, into the world, marking the beginning of their journey as parents.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/06/Grace-P2.jpg><p>Finally, approximately three years after their first meeting, Wynonna Judd and Arch Kelley III took the significant step of exchanging vows on January 21, 1996. At the time of their wedding, Wynonna was already carrying their second child, who happens to be Grace Pauline Kelley.</p><p>At first, things appeared to be going really smoothly for the couple. However, despite the initial optimism surrounding their marriage, difficulties soon arose, and the couple faced irreconcilable differences. Tragically, just two years after their wedding, the once-happy couple decided to part ways in 1998.</p><p>The dissolution of their marriage occurred when Grace Pauline Kelley was a mere two years old, leaving her caught in the midst of the upheaval. Grace would go on to have a number of stepfathers as her mother remarried two more times.</p><h3><strong>She Has a Brother Who is a Rising Musician</strong></h3><p>Grace Pauline Kelley’s older brother, Elijah Judd, was born on December 23, 1994, and has since carved his own path in the music industry. Now 29 years old, he has already made notable strides in his musical career, displaying a talent reminiscent of his renowned mother. Elijah’s musical journey leans towards classical Christmas music, capturing the spirit of the holiday season.</p><p>With a handful of music credits to his name, he has established himself as a rising artist. In 2006, he unveiled his first album, a collection of soul-stirring Christmas melodies that resonated with listeners. But, beyond his solo endeavors, Elijah also played a significant role in assisting his grandmother, Naomi Judd, with her highly acclaimed album, “A Classic Christmas.”</p><p>Demonstrating his versatility as a vocalist, he lent his backup vocals to several tracks, adding depth and harmony to the enchanting melodies. The collaborative effort proved to be a resounding success, both commercially and in terms of popularity. The album soared to the top of the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks Chart, captivating audiences for months following its release.</p><h3><strong>Grace Had a Strained Relationship With Her Famous Mother</strong></h3><p>Grace Pauline Kelley’s relationship with her mother, Wynonna Judd, has not always been a smooth one. As a matter of fact, their relationship has experienced its share of challenges which were widely reported on in the past. Back in 2014, The National Enquirer published an exposé detailing the strained dynamic between Grace Kelley and Wynonna Judd. The article claimed that Grace, then 17 years old, had run away from home and had moved in with her mother’s sister, Ashley Judd, following their falling out.</p><p>Grace refused to go back to her mother for a long time. Wynonna later claimed that her sister, Ashley had stolen Grace from her. The whole situation led to a fallout between Grace’s mother, Wynonna, and Ashley Judd. Ashley even filed a police report in Tennessee, alleging that Wynonna had attempted to track her car using a GPS device, probably to monitor Grace.</p><p>According to The National Enquirer’s report at the time, Grace and her mother had been at odds for several years. There were instances of tension between them, including an incident in 2011 when Grace reportedly disappeared for several days during a layover while returning home from boarding school. The clashes between Grace and Wynonna escalated during Wynonna’s third marriage, and it was claimed that Grace was sent to a behavioral camp for six months in 2012.</p><p>It is believed that Grace may have had a difficult childhood because of her mother’s divorce from her father and her mother’s subsequent marriages, However, this school of thought has not been completely proven to be correct. What is clear is that, at some point in her life, Grace and her mother did not see eye to eye.</p><p>However, more recent developments suggest that Grace and her mother have made efforts to reconcile and improve their relationship. While specific details about their journey of reconciliation are not readily available, it appears that they have managed to mend fences and foster a better connection in recent times.</p><h2><strong>Grace Pauline Kelley Has a Troubled History of Legal Woes and Prison Sentences</strong></h2><p>Despite being born into a household synonymous with fame and recognition, Grace Pauline Kelley has endured a turbulent journey, far from the conventional life one might expect. Over the years, she has faced a series of legal troubles that have cast a shadow over her, leading to multiple encounters with the justice system and periods of incarceration.</p><p>The beginning of Grace’s legal woes can be traced back to June 2016 when she was arrested after being caught with hard drugs. She was subsequently charged with the serious offenses of meth manufacture, delivery, sale, and possession with intent at Williamson County Court in Tennessee. Grace eventually opted to plead guilty, recognizing the need to take accountability for her actions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/06/Grace-P3.jpg><p>Following her guilty plea, Grace was sentenced to serve an 11-month and 29-day jail term. However, a fraction of this sentence required physical confinement, as she was only to spend 30 days behind bars and then the rest of the prison term on probation.</p><p>Following her release from the Williamson County Detention Center on June 16, 2017, she was instructed to continue her sentence through a court-ordered drug program. This program aimed to address the underlying issues contributing to her legal entanglements and provide an opportunity for rehabilitation.</p><h3><strong>She was Arrested For The Second Time in 2018</strong></h3><p>After Grace was released on probation, there was a glimmer of hope that she could turn her life around. Unfortunately, her journey to rehabilitation hit a roadblock in 2018 when she was arrested yet again for violating her probation and absconding from one of her recovery court programs. She was arraigned and the judge sentenced her to eight years at the West Tennessee State Penitentiary in 2018. Her sentencing <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">made headlines</a> around the USA.</p><p>However, despite the seemingly insurmountable circumstances, a stroke of fortune would eventually shine upon Grace once again. This is because, in November 2019, after serving just one year of her sentence, she was granted parole for the second time.&nbsp;Though she was granted parole, it was not without strict conditions and stringent guidelines.</p><p>According to reports, Grace was ordered to adhere to a set of rules and regulations, ensuring that she would fulfill the remainder of her sentence while under close supervision.</p><h3><strong>Her Third Arrest Happened in 2020</strong></h3><p>In a disheartening turn of events, Grace Pauline Kelley’s struggle with legal issues persisted in April 2020, less than one year after she was released on parole. This time, just like before, she was arrested yet again for violating her probation related to her drug case. Again, she was dragged before the court.</p><p>Grace was subsequently sentenced to serve an additional eight years behind bars for her bad behavior. With this new sentence, Grace faced the prospect of remaining incarcerated until 2028, as her release date was initially set for that year. However, a year later, in 2021, there was a glimmer of hope as Grace was granted parole yet again and allowed to go home under supervision.</p><p>Alongside her parole, she received a court order to undergo comprehensive drug treatment. Also, it was confirmed that Grace had committed herself to initial treatment for her drug addiction, which included aftercare support and the requirement to submit to random drug tests. These measures were implemented to provide the necessary guidance and structure to aid in her recovery journey.</p><h3><strong>Grace was Arrested For The 4th Time in 2021</strong></h3><p>Regrettably, Just months after she was released on parole in 2021, Grace Pauline Kelley’s tumultuous journey of legal woes took a new turn after she was arrested for the 4th time in August of that year. The U.S. Sun reported that she was apprehended once again for violating her probation. Following this arrest, she was incarcerated at Williamson County Jail in Tennessee.</p><p>As a result of her repeated probation violations, Grace’s release date was rescheduled for June 2024, prolonging her time behind bars. Moreover, her next parole hearing was scheduled for December 2022, signifying an opportunity for review and potential reconsideration of her circumstances.</p><p>At the parole hearing in December 2022, Grace was granted parole once again. According to reports, on December 29, 2022, she <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">was released from prison</a> with a new set of rules to follow while she observes her parole. Currently, Grace is still on parole, navigating the delicate path of reintegration into society under the watchful eye of the justice system. The hopes and aspirations of her loved ones and well-wishers are united in the desire that she steers clear of further legal entanglements.</p><h3><strong>What Her Mother Has To Say About Grace’s Legal Woes</strong></h3><p>In 2020, Wynonna Judd, Grace Pauline Kelley’s mother, openly addressed her daughter’s ongoing struggles with the law, offering a glimpse into their complex relationship. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">During an interview</a> on Fox Nation’s The Pursuit! with John Rich, Wynonna candidly discussed Grace’s turbulent journey.</p><p>The famous singer, recognizing her daughter’s resilience, described Grace as the strongest Judd woman in their family’s history. She expressed admiration for Grace’s current state of health, noting that Grace surpasses her own well-being at the age of 23. However, reflecting on her own experiences, she even went so far as to suggest that she could have faced similar challenges had she not been consumed by her music career, which entailed traveling the world with her late mother, Naomi Judd, as the celebrated country music duo, The Judds.</p><p>She explained that she will continue to support her daughter and provide all the assistance she needs on her way to recovery from her legal woes and drug history.</p><h2><strong>Wynonna Judd’s Daughter</strong><strong> is Now a Mother</strong></h2><p>According to our findings, Grace Pauline Kelley is now a mother.&nbsp;Reports indicate that Grace became pregnant during one of her periods of release on parole, and by the time she returned to prison in 2021, she was already pregnant. A woman called&nbsp;Florence Fort, who was incarcerated alongside Grace from August to October 2021, <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">provided insights</a> into this significant development.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/06/Grace-P4.jpg><p>Florence, confirming the news, revealed that Grace was indeed pregnant during their time together in the facility. According to Florence, Grace had already chosen a name for her baby and expressed excitement about becoming a mother. Florence also said during her incarceration, Grace maintained contact with her famous mother, Wynonna, despite their previously strained relationship.</p><p>Florence shared that Grace frequently called Wynonna and they had several conversations together during that time. Also, the inmates even organized a baby shower for Grace in prison, during which Wynonna called to offer her support. Interestingly, Florence also disclosed that Grace’s baby’s father was also incarcerated during the same period. The nature of their relationship remains unclear.</p><p>Later, some court documents exclusively obtained by The Sun shed light on Grace’s situation. The report showed that on March 25th, 2022, a Tennessee judge approved Grace’s furlough request due to her pregnancy. Consequently, she was temporarily released from prison in time to give birth. Grace has since given birth to a baby girl, with reports suggesting that the birth took place in May 2022. She would later be taken back to prison after giving birth.</p><p>According to reports, the arrival of her daughter has brought immense joy to Grace’s life. Following her release from prison on parole in December 2022, she proudly shared photos of her eight-month-old daughter on social media. In these heartwarming pictures, both Grace and her daughter can be seen smiling, capturing the love and bond between a mother and her child.</p><h3><strong>What is Grace Pauline Kelley’s Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Grace Pauline Kelley’s net worth is not readily available due to her legal woes but some reports have pegged it around $500,000. It is not clear how this figure was arrived at.</p><h3><strong>How Old is Grace Pauline Kelley?</strong></h3><p>Grace Pauline Kelley is currently 27 years old. We know this because she was born&nbsp;on the 21st of June 1996. This means her star sign is Gemini. Wynonna Judd’s daughter was born in California, USA, and grew up there.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZMSpu4yiqmafopawpnnPmqyloZ6aeqyxy6WcsmWRoblurcGorK1lp667sLrNmmSjrZSZwG6wwK6eoayVp3w%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-gray-connolly-details-to-know-about.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Gray Connolly?
