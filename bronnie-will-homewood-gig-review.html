They were supported by Oakley Orchard and Harri Oakland.</p><p>The event itself was sold out, with much promotion from each act. Fans were lined up in front of UnPlug Birmingham, some of who had woken up at five am for the concert.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Woo! Our headline gig in Birmingham tomorrow has SOLD OUT – Can't wait to see you there!! (stay tuned for my big announcement tonight) ??? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/d0IF7bkHnY</a></p><p>— BRONNIE (@BronnieMusic) <a href=#>February 3, 2017</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>The crowd looks amazing today!!</p><p>— Will (@WillHomewood) <a href=#>February 4, 2017</a></p><p>https://twitter.com/liamftparker/status/827761123738910720</p><p>The buzz amongst the fans in the queue was completely obvious, and as we waited for the doors to open, we could hear music from inside. This encouraged the eager fans to sing along. Excitement built throughout the crowd, especially when Bronnie’s management came out to film the fans. Later, gifts created by Will Homewood was given out, just before doors opened.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Been making cute gifts for you guys! ? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/p2de0P4Evg</a></p><p>— Will (@WillHomewood) <a href=#>February 4, 2017</a></p><p>Inside, the crowd was eager to see the acts. Down in the green room, Will Homewood was full of adrenaline. He literally couldn’t wait to go on stage. Bronnie was quietly preparing for the gig. Harri Oakland and Oakley Orchard were totally chilled out.</p><p>Back upstairs, Bronnie and Will Homewood came out on stage for a question and answer session with their fans. Questions were flown out from the crowd. We found out that Bronnie’s favourite animal is a bearded dragon, whereas Will Homewood likes monkeys. Their Dominoes orders are Texan BBQ for Bronnie; Will Homewood likes to create his own pizza with pineapple and sweetcorn. There were questions about BronCat – a fan’s cat that Bronnie named; who she adores. Other questions spanned from favourite bands to favourite covers, from Starbucks orders to their fans.</p><p>Oakley Orchard was first up on the stage. His set included covers, where he started off with The Vamps’ “All Night”, followed by Ed Sheeran’s “Shape of You” and New Hope Club’s “Perfume”. It’s hard to believe that he is 13 years old. His vocal range is completely on point, and he worked the stage, all the while playing his guitar. He nailed every song and there was no sign of nerves whatsoever. He is an inspiration to every young musician out there, proving that his place is on the stage singing to fans.</p><p>You can catch Oakley Orchard at <a href=#>The Big Party in Nuneaton on 18 March 2017</a>. He has&nbsp;uploads covers frequently on his <a href=#>YouTube Channel</a>, the most popular of which are: The Vamps’ “<a href=#>All Night</a>“, Adele’s “<a href=#>Rolling In The Deep</a>“, The Tide’s “<a href=#>Click My Fingers</a>“, and Shawn Mendes’ “<a href=#>Stitches</a>“. All of which have over 1,000 views.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Guess from the caption how excited I got when <a href=#>@oakleyorchard</a> started singing <a href=#>@NewHopeClub</a> ?? <a href=#>@NewHopeBlake</a> <a href=#>@NewHopeGeorge</a> <a href=#>@NewHopeReece</a> ? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/wHNxvE3Ign</a></p><p>— kai/mellohi ! ? ??

SEEING TAYLOR (@madsniamh) <a href=#>February 4, 2017</a></p><p>The next support act was Harri Oakland. He previously supported <a href=#>Josh Taylor on his “Hot For Me” Tour at the Birmingham date</a>, which is where he met Bronnie and Will Homewood. He kickstarted his set with Ne-Yo’s “Closer”. His deep and meaningful voice flowed out perfectly amongst the crowd. With help from the crowd, he sang his songs throughout, giving it his all on the stage, sending out brilliant performance vibes. He also sang Shawn Mendes’ “Stitches” making it totally his own.</p><p>He occasionally uploads videos on his <a href=#>YouTube channel</a>, but his <a href=#>Facebook page</a> is where it’s at. There are plenty of amazing videos to watch, we suggest you head over there now.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>He's singing <a href=#>#stitches</a>! <a href=#>@harrioakland_</a> is going for it! Check out the CelebMix snapchat for more on <a href=#>@BronnieMusic</a> & <a href=#>@WillHomewood</a>'s gig <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/FVHcEDN5aW</a></p><p>— CelebMix (@CelebMix) <a href=#>February 4, 2017</a></p><p>Since this was a co-headline tour between Bronnie and Will Homewood; it all came down to a coin on who would perform last. It was decided during the Q&A’s that Bronnie would go first and that Will Homewood would close the show. So Bronnie was on next.</p><p>Bronnie had a varied set, starting off with her&nbsp;original song “Social Rejects”, into an amazing cover version of Paramore’s “Still Into You” – that we will never forget; then Kelly Clarkson’s “My Life Would Suck Without You”. She then surprised everyone with a new original song titled “So What” which then lead into the slow but beautiful “Imaginary Friend”. Afterwards, she rocked out on stage with her most popular original song “<a href=#>High School Sucks</a>“, before going for it on her incredible mashup of “Teenage Dirtbag” and “Stacy’s Mom” by Wheatus and Fountains of Wayne, respectively. She ended her set with help from the crowd with her amazing original song “<a href=#>Screw You</a>“.</p><p>Bronnie is definitely a singer you need to see live. She’s energetic, fun, genuine and full of stage presence. This was her first gig of 2017, but certainly won’t be her last. You can catch her on <a href=#>Walwin’s headline tour</a> – London (Birmingham & Manchester are cancelled); <a href=#>Harvey’s Live Tour 2017</a> – Glasgow, Manchester, London (sold out); <a href=#>RoadTrip’s Miss Taken EP Tour 2017</a> – Manchester, Liverpool, London, Bristol, Glasgow; and at <a href=#>Little Mix’s Wirral Live headline gig as special guest support</a>. We bet she has more gigs lined up soon. Don’t forget to check out her <a href=#>YouTube Channel</a> for amazing covers and some original songs.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>She's on stage now! <a href=#>@BronnieMusic</a> is singing <a href=#>@paramore</a>'s <a href=#>#stillintoyou</a> on @plug_birmingham stage!

He started off his set with a gorgeous rendition of Gnarls Barkley’s “Crazy” which fitted his vocals brilliantly; he went into Busted’s “What I Go To School For” and the heart-melting covers of McFly’s “Obviously” and The Vamps’ “Somebody To You”. But he really came out of his shell when he sang his originals. He nailed “Crossroads” flooding it with emotion, but it was his latest original “<a href=#>Summer Love</a>” that he transcended beautifully across the crowd. The final two songs were his incredible original track “Dilemma” and a brilliant cover of Stevie Wonder’s “Superstition”; it was clear adrenaline was pumping through him because he performed the song amazingly.</p><p>It’s clear that Will Homewood is meant to be on the stage! You can catch him next at <a href=#>The Big Party in Nuneaton on 18 March 2017</a>, along with Oakley Orchard; as well as <a href=#>Elite Talent Live in Milton Keynes on 1 April 2017</a>, with Over Atlantic headlining. Make sure you check out his <a href=#>Twitter</a>, <a href=#>Instagram</a> and <a href=#>Facebook</a> for all his amazing cover videos, and don’t forget to listen to his originals on his <a href=#>SoundCloud account</a>. “<a href=#>Summer Love</a>” is totally a must-listen track.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>He's singing <a href=#>@Busted</a>'s <a href=#>#WhatIGoToSchoolFor</a>! <a href=#>@WillHomewood</a> is on the @plug_birmingham stage right now!

Merchandise was also being sold at the back of the venue.</p><p>If anything, this co-headline gig went smoothly.
