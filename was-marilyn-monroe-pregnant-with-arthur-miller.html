It is hard to hear her name without picturing her in The Seven Year Itch wearing a windblown white dress. This comes as no surprise, as it is one of her most recognizable film scenes and a shot that depicts her exuberant personality.</p><p>This gorgeous celebrity’s acting and singing talents, as well as her <a href=#>dating</a> past, are widely recognized. In the beginning, Marilyn’s films grossed a total of $200 million between There’s No Business Like Show Business, Some Like It Hot, and a number of other profitable films. Her estate remains wealthy, reportedly earning $8 million in 2020 alone.</p><p>A lesser-known aspect of her life, though, is parenthood.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Marilyn Monroe: Was She Ever Pregnant? Does She Have Kids?</h2><p>Marilyn was <a href=#>pregnant </a>more than once, but she never carried any of them to term. Marilyn has been married more than once, and photos of her, while she was pregnant, have been made public. Because of this, many people think that she may have children, even famous ones, who are living today.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram">https://www.instagram.com/p/CifcHr6OlAv/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</figure><p>She was said to have been pregnant three times, but two of them ended in miscarriages, and one ended in heartbreak because of an ectopic pregnancy. Marilyn never had any more kids after that.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Did Marilyn Monroe Have An Abortion?</h2><p>There is no evidence that Marilyn had an abortion, but abortions were illegal when she was alive. So it’s hard to be sure if she did or not.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Playwright Arthur Miller Is Said To Have Been The Father Of Marilyn Monroe’s Children</h2><p>The famous playwright <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Arthur Miller</a>, to whom <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Marilyn </a>was married from 1956 to 1961, is said to have fathered all three of her known pregnancies. Arthur married Marilyn after meeting her at a party in 1950. They stayed in touch over the years by writing letters to each other.</p><p>Marilyn died in 1963, a year after she and Arthur got a divorce. It is thought that she took too many sleeping pills. At that time, she was 36 years old.</p><p>Metro says that empty medicine bottles with doses that were several times the limit were found at the scene, which pretty much rules out an accidental overdose. The Los Angeles Police Department said that her death was caused by a self-administered overdose of sedative drugs and that the cause of death was probably suicide.</p><p>But a <a href=# rel=noopener>Netflix </a>documentary from 2022 called The Mystery of Marilyn Monroe: The Unheard Tapes suggests that the story most people know about Marilyn’s <a href=#>death </a>may be false. In an interview, Walter Schaefer, the owner of Hollywood Ambulance, said that Marilyn’s psychiatrist might have found her alive, which was not what had been saying before. Walter says that she died on the way to the hospital in an ambulance, not in her bed as most people think.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Marilyn Was Also In Relationships With Other Famous People</h2><p>Marilyn was married three times in her short life, as was already said. In 1942, she married her high school boyfriend Jimmy Dougherty. At the time, she was 16 years old, and he was a marine merchant who helped her get away from her troubled childhood and mentally ill mother.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram">https://www.instagram.com/p/ChpZBpoOjek/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</figure><p>In 1946, they broke up. Marilyn got married again in 1954, this time to the great baseball player Joe DiMaggio. After nine months, they split up, and in 1956, Marilyn married Arthur.</p><p>Marilyn was also linked to Marlon Brando, Frank Sinatra, and the French actor Yves Montand in a romantic way. And, in fact, there are rumors that one of Marilyn’s pregnancies may have been with Yves, not Arthur. These rumors haven’t been proven, though, and Marilyn’s love life is full of grey areas.</p><p>There are also rumors that she was in a relationship with President John F. Kennedy, to whom she famously sang “Happy Birthday, Mr. President.” Marilyn did a lot in her life, but sadly, her dream of becoming a mother never came true.</p><p><strong>Related Stories Recommended By Writer:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>Who Is Adam Levine Girlfriend?
