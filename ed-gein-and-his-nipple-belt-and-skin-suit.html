Raised by his devoutly religious parents on a farm outside of town, Gein was a shy and withdrawn child. His father died when he was nine years old, and his mother passed away when he was sixteen.&nbsp;</p><p>This double tragedy profoundly affected Gein, who became increasingly isolated from the outside world. In 1957, police made a gruesome discovery on the Gein property: the remains of several murdered victims and evidence of grave robbing and body snatching.&nbsp;</p><p>Investigators also found that Gein had made belts and lampshades out of human skin and attempted to <a href=#>fashion</a> a “woman suit” out of female victims’ corpses. In 1968, Gein was found guilty but insane of first-degree murder and committed to a mental institution, where he died in 1984.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ed Gein Made N*pple Belts & Skull Bowls</h2><p>In 1955, his mother died of cancer, and Gein began to unravel. He started to indulge in necrophilia and cannibalism, and he also began to mutilate corpses, using their skin to make belts and bowls. In 1957, he murdered two women and used their skin to create a “woman suit” that he would wear to feel closer to his dead mother.&nbsp;</p><p>Gein of Plainfield, Wis., also used the skins of several women to make costumes, which he told police he wanted to climb inside to “become” his deceased mother.</p><p>Upon his arrest in 1957, he, known as the Butcher of Plainfield, admitted to the murders of Bernice and local bar owner Mary Hogan, who had disappeared three years earlier, as well as digging up the bodies of women from the local cemetery to retrieve their bodies. Parts of her terrible exploits.</p><p>His sick crimes have inspired many horrendous peoples, including Psycho’s Norman Bates, the guardian of his mother’s body at the Leatherface House during the Chainsaw Massacre in Texas, and serial killer Silence. of the Lambs Buffalo Bill.</p><p>But they have also haunted the peaceful town of Plainfield, with a population of about 900, where some reports have heard ghostly voices, seen mysterious figures, and even been attacked by an invisible spirit soul. In the Discovery Channel documentary Real Psycho, psychic investigators Steve Shippy and Cindy Kaza have just visited the city to investigate reports of paranormal activity.</p><p>He used specialized equipment; the couple visited Gein’s now demolished home and cemetery, where his family and victims are buried, and even met a man who claimed pets and members of his family. His family member died after buying a killer knife.</p><p>Local historian Dave Bignell told Steve, “People think the area is haunted. They see shadows where they shouldn’t be. They heard screams and groans, primarily from women.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Things You Might Not Know About Gein’s N*pple Belt</h2><p>The nipple belt was one of their main accessories of Gein, and he used human skin to make trash cans, a skull bowl, and a corset made from the skin of a woman’s legs and figure.</p><p>Between 1947 to 1952, Gein killed at least six women. The n*pple belt that Gein wore over his bare crotch was one of his best signature outfits.</p><p>Ed Gein created these peculiar objects by dissecting parts of the human body.&nbsp;</p><p>His famous n*pple belt was strewn with n*pples, and he also made a soup bowl out of a human skull and a lampshade out of human skin.&nbsp;</p><p>Gein created a bowl out of a human skull and a curtain to decorate the woman’s lips.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCxw2aenqGeYq6vsIyhoKxlnp69sbjEZpmepKRirq%2BwjKyioqZdqMKqwI4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./79183-11-weird-facts-about-farts-you-never-knew-like-that-they-can-kill-you-probably.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="11 Weird Facts About Farts You Never Knew, Like That They Can Kill You, Probably">&larr;
