But recently, it's made the headlines for the abundance of American candy shops and illegal goods seized by authorities.</p><p>In fact, it's become so controversial that <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section-topic>Marks & Spencer</a> boss Stuart Machin <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news>said</a>: "When I walk down Oxford Street today, I see a stark reality staring back at me. One in five shops sit vacant, there is a growing proliferation of tacky candy stores and near £600,000 of counterfeit goods have been seized from hawkers this year.</p><p>"The effects of <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section-topic>Covid</a> have brought a street that was once the jewel of UK shopping to its knees." I've noticed the change in the area too - I was tempted to throw a funeral for Topshop's flagship shop.</p><p><b>READ MORE: </b><a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news>Win six free VIP tickets to London’s Soultown Festival 2022</a></p><p>In a bid to find out if Stuart was right, I headed down to the tourist heaven, intending to compare it to its posher neighbours Regent Street and Bond Streets old and new alike.</p><p>Stepping out of Bond Street station, I was immediately bumped into by a crowd of tourists and accosted by a woman peddling roses. Not off to a great start.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mylondon.news/incoming/article24723705.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IMG_4437.jpg><p>Wandering down the eternally busy roads, I noticed a few changes since my last trip. The open shops sold a variety of goods at affordable prices - technology, shoes, clothes, Curry's, Office and H&M - but the experience was marred by the abundance of closed shutters, building sites and American candy shops.</p><p>I counted five of the latter on my short stroll and they were attracting tourists like magnets. The air was thick with their confusion and disorientation, both Kryptonite to Londoners. Oxford Street was loud too; each shop was battling for attention by blaring out different songs and the honking cars added to the din.</p><p>On the bright side, the street was remarkably clean. Surprising for central London, the bins were neatly stacked in aesthetic little towers and the pavement was devoid of litter bar a few chips happily being feasted on by a pigeon. But while the area used to be the city's main shopping district, it no longer deserves the title. Like so much of London, it's been eviscerated by Covid and is but a shell of what it used to be thanks to American candy shops replacing the likes of the HMV flagship shop.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mylondon.news/incoming/article24723706.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IMG_4449.jpg><p>Taking a sharp right, I entered my next destination: Regent Street. Here, tourists in ill-fitting satin dresses and slicked-back hair adhering to some imaginary dress code replaced the backpacks and velcro sandals I'd left behind.</p><p>Regent Street was a different kind of loud to its neighbour. Instead of music, every shops was emitting a different perfume, making for an olfactory experience so overwhelming I started breathing through my mouth.</p><p>The street was as clean as Oxford Street and every building was matching white brick, giving the street a more unified look than the hotchpotch of architecture I'd just experienced. Fewer closed shutters greeted me here - instead I was promised 'reopenings' and 'refurbishments'.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mylondon.news/incoming/article24723707.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IMG_4456.jpg><p>Though better dressed, the tourists were still as populous. The shiny luxury goods kept distracting them from the simple human task of walking in a straight line and they stopped haphazardly whenever they felt like it. Nobody on a regular London budget would ever shop in Furla, Burberry or Breitling. It's too inaccessible for most people to be London's main shopping area but is much more deserving than Oxford Street of the mantle 'tourist attraction'.</p><p>Hoping to escape the crowds, I took another right into the ultra-luxurious Old Bond Street and New Bond Street. Unfortunately, it was just as crowded as the others but there was a distinct lack of bumbling about.</p><p>Instead, there was an air of reverence surrounding the street, almost like everyone was afraid if they spoke too loudly, they'd break something worth thousands. Despite myself, even I was slightly dumbfounded by the glittering jewels and golden house facades.</p><p>Perhaps it was the abundance of security guards or the expensive goods, but everyone was much more respectful in Bond Street. Despite not being able to afford anything there, it's the only place I'd willingly return to purely because no one bumped into me or stopped in the middle of the street for a selfie.</p><p>Oxford Street is well and truly past its prime. But Regent Street is unaffordable and Bond Street is in a whole other league of expensive. If you're a Londoner looking to do a spot of shopping, avoid all three. But for a nice central London window shopping excursion, your best bet is Bond Street.</p><p><b>Which shopping street is your favourite?
