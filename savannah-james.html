LeBron first met Savannah in 2002. At the time, LeBron played for St. Vincent-St. Mary High School, while his lady love, was a cheerleader and a softball player for the rival school.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/12/20/lebron-james-wedding-savannah-brinson-1576835409174.jpg><p>The duo went out on a date at an Outback Steakhouse, and with more dates, love started brewing between them. A couple of years later, LeBron was drafted by <i>Cleveland Cavaliers,</i> but that did not weaken their love.&nbsp;</p><p>As of now, the duo is together for almost eighteen years and are successfully raising three children. Recently, the couple took a trip to their son's basketball game. Their enthusiasm and support for their son went viral after the photos of the pair were snapped.</p><h2>Her Wedding Details</h2><p>In front of 200 guests, the duo exchanged a wedding ring with each other. At the fantastic venue in San Diego, the pair performed their bridal ceremony under massive security measures.</p><p>According to <i>USA Today</i>, the news helicopters who were keen on taking video footage from above returned empty-handed as they used umbrellas to protect the identity of the guests. But as per close sources, Miami Heat owner <strong>Micky Arison</strong>, coach <strong>Erik Spoelstra,</strong> and <strong>Dwyane Wade</strong> are some of the few names in the guest list.</p><p>Talking to the media, Savannah said that the marriage turned out to be her <a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>dream wedding</strong></a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Raising Three Children</h2><p>When LeBron was playing in his rookie years, Savannah became pregnant with the pair's first child. In an interview, she said,</p><p>"I was thinking, what am I going to tell my parents? What's going to happen to his career?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/12/20/Children-1576835481441.JPG><p>But opposite to her thinking, LeBron was very supportive and showed his love towards her. She gave birth to <strong>LeBron James Jr</strong>. (Bronny) on October 6, 2004. Three years later, on June 14, 2007, the duos' family expanded from three to four with the birth of <strong>Bryce Maximus</strong>.</p><p>After their weddings in 2013, the lovebirds were ready for the next child as well.
