He used new investor funds to pay out returns to existing investors, but in 2008 he wasn't able to cover all redemption requests from the fund. Billions of dollars were lost. Ruth Madoff reportedly wasn't aware of or involved in her husband's crimes.

Madoff Investment Securities firm, didn't appear to have any role in the huge cover-up by Madoff. Her husband was the so-called "Ponzi king" for having orchestrated the multibillion-dollar fraud that victimized thousands, decimating their <a href=#>retirement</a> and life savings.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Bernie and Ruth Madoff were married on Nov. 28, 1959.

One <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">victim said in court</a> to Madoff, "Your wife, rightfully so, has been vilified and shunned by her friends in the community."

This is $250,000 in cash and $344,000 held in trusts for two grandchildren. Trustee Irving Picard agreed with Ruth that her settlement isn't evidence she admitted to “participating in or knowing of Bernard Madoff’s fraud.”</p><p>Ruth is also required to report any expenditures over $100 to Picard to ensure no other financial accounts are hidden. Since the fraud was exposed, she has lived with a sister and brother-in-law, with her son Andrew before his death in 2014, and with her late son Mark's widow Susan Elkin.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae4psDRnpiloaOpe6S7zGilnqxdrLyzwMdoqa6smGK6orDOn51mppWperi70a2faA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./disgraced-gp-avoids-prison-over-video-of-man-having-sex-with-sna.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Disgraced GP avoids prison over video of man having sex with snake">&larr;
