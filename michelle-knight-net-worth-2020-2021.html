Well, if you’re ready, let’s start.</p><h2>Early Life & Biography</h2><p>Michelle Knight was born on 23 April 1981 in Cleveland, Ohio. She has two siblings, Freddie Knight, and Katie Hudson. &nbsp;She came from poor family background and had to take care of her brother. &nbsp;Katie was born during the period of her disappearance. The family could not even afford a coach, let alone a stove. To make a hot meal, she would resort to using a heater just to make a hot dog.</p><p>She had a pretty rough upbringing that led her to run away from home once as a teenager. Knight slept in a garbage can wondering where her next meal would come from.&nbsp; If that was not enough, she underwent the trauma of being sexually molested and raped by a male relative when she was just a young girl.</p><p>She eventually resorted to going back home after spending a few nights out in the cold and hungry. Soon after she went back to school and before she knew it, Michelle got sexually engaged with her male classmate resulting in teenage pregnancy. She eventually had to drop out of school, especially after being mocked by her fellow students. She gave birth to a baby boy and raised him at home. Information about her parents’ names has not been disclosed.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>Michelle spent most of her teenage years chained up like an animal by a psycho and sexual predator. Before that, she was raped by a male relative, something that no child should ever encounter. &nbsp;In addition to that, she had a son when she was about 12 years old by a classmate she was involved in. She struggled to raise her son, seeing her family was poor. An incident that almost tore her apart is when she lost her son to foster care. Her mother’s boyfriend injured the boy’s knee when he was drunk. Her world was slowly crumbling piece by piece.</p><p>On the day of her disappearance, she was on her way to court to fight for her son’s custody that was two years and a few months at the time. As fate would have it, the poor girl got lost on her way to court as she thought that she could have a sigh of relief when a man posing as someone who wanted to help approached her. That was the beginning of her nightmare as the man was her kidnapper, Ariel Castro, who robbed her ten years of her life.</p><p>A few years later, after trying to get over the trauma she went through, true love came her way. She met Miguel Rodriguez through a friend on Facebook. They later bumped into each other at a restaurant, and their bond was spiked. The couple later got married on May 6th, 2016. They currently have no children, but she is happily married. She later changed her name to Lily Rose Lee<strong>.</strong></p><h2>Age, Height, and Weight</h2><p>Being born on 23 April 1981, Michelle Knight is 43 years old as of today’s date 20th July 2024.

She underwent some serious torture, abuse, and rape for ten years without seeing the light of day. She had several miscarriages that left her barren due to the severe physical abuse she went through.&nbsp; A shimmer of hope came on May 6th, 2013, after Amanda and her daughter, Jocelyn, that she had conceived with the rapist managed to escape and call for help. Castro was arrested and later committed suicide in prison.</p><p>Following the trauma she underwent, Michelle found healing through writing a memoir of the horrific incidents. Her first book, Finding Me, was released a year later on the date of her rescue, May 6th, 2014. The book was well received and even became a New York second Bestseller.

She is also currently taking piano lessons and cooking classes and reclaiming her life.</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><p>The greatest achievement that she has earned is having recovered from the trauma that she went through for eleven years. She did not let her tragic ordeal destroy her. Moreover, her books became New York Bestsellers.&nbsp; Additionally, Finding Me made it to Amazon.com’s top 20 list of the best memoirs.</p><h2>Net Worth & Salary of Michelle Knight in 2024</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wealthypersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Michelle-Knight-Net-Worth.jpg><p>After she spent most of her life chained up and abused, Michelle had a difficult time finding a job.

Although she has managed to reclaim back her life and even authored two books, her earnings have not been disclosed to the public. As of July 2024, Her net worth is, however, estimated to be around $500 thousand.</p><p>Knight has gone through what so many people view as dreadful. Not many would have recovered from such trauma.
