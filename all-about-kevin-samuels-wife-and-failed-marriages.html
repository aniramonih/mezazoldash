In the latter days of his life, he was romantically linked to a few women, but it was not certain if he was in a serious relationship with any of them.&nbsp;</strong><strong>The late American internet personality also had a daughter, his only child, with his first wife.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Kevin took the internet by storm in 2020 when he became a polarizing figure, thanks to his takes on relationships in today’s world. Unsurprisingly, this got people curious about his love life, and for a long time, all that was known about that was speculation. It was even rumored at some point that he is gay. This was so because Kevin kept a tight lid on his personal life.</p><h2><strong>Was Kevin Samuels Married?</strong></h2><p>Kevin Samuels had been married and divorced twice. Both of the marriages were short-lived; according to several reports, that was also the case with the other relationships he was involved in. Kevin reportedly didn’t stay with any woman beyond three years.</p><p>Even after he passed, the identities of the women the late YouTuber was married to have been a mystery to the public. This is so because Samuels carefully avoided discussing this area of his life. Also, he only gained public attention in 2020. Given that he passed in May 2022, he, unfortunately, didn’t live long enough in the limelight for details about this aspect of his life to be dug up.</p><p>Thanks to his controversial take on relationships, Samuels got people so much interested in his romantic relationship. This made it difficult for him to continue keeping information about his failed marriages away from the public. Although the identities of the women he was married to remain unknown, a few deets have been uncovered about the marriage.</p><h2><strong>Was Kevin Samuels Married at the Time of His Death?</strong></h2><p>At the time of his death, Kevin Samuels was not married. It was widely believed that he was not in any serious relationship, almost as much as it was speculated that he might be gay. But the fact of the matter is that Kevin was not one of those celebrated figures prone to discussing their personal lives in the public space. He might have been in a relationship with someone but kept it away from the public.</p><p>According to reports, the late, controversial YouTuber was with a woman the night he passed. It was said that he fell on top of the woman, who called 911 to report that he complained of chest pain before he collapsed. The identity of this woman remains unknown to the public, and the nature of his relationship with her isn’t known either. It was only certain that she wasn’t his wife.</p><h2><strong>What Happened to Kevin Samuels First Marriage?</strong></h2><p>Kevin Samuels’ first wife was his childhood sweetheart. Following a long time of speculation about his love life, Samuels offered in one of his many interviews that he has been married twice. It was no surprise that this revelation triggered more curiosity directed at knowing who his wives were.</p><p>Well, Kevin would later disclose that the first woman he was married to was his high school sweetheart. Even though he refrained from disclosing the name of the woman, he shared that he had known his first wife since 4th grade. Details of how they fell in love and eventually got married are not known but Samuels disclosed that they were married for one year.</p><p>Based on what he shared, the marriage was short-lived because it wasn’t meant to be in the first place. He explained that they were better off as friends; entering into a romantic relationship and subsequently getting married complicated things for them.</p><h3><strong>What We Know About Kevin Samuels’s Second Wife</strong></h3><p>Kevin Samuels decided to give marriage another shot after his first marriage failed. Roughly seven years after he divorced his first wife, the late YouTuber fell in love again with another woman who later became his second wife.</p><p>Like his first wife, the identity of his second is not known to the public. However, Samuels disclosed that the marriage lasted for only three years. Speaking about his second marriage in an interview with LVAD-TV, Kevin revealed that they parted ways due to some irreconcilable differences.</p><h3><strong>How Many Were Kevin Samuels Children?</strong></h3><p>The late YouTuber has only one child, a daughter whose name is yet to be revealed. Samuels had the child with his first wife, and according to multiple reports, the girl child was born on the 29th of June 2000. This means his daughter is currently 23 years old.</p><p>The information available indicates he shared custody of the child with his first wife. However, it is said that he was not on good terms with his daughter when he died. This is reported to be so because of the kind of comments Kevin was making about women. However, this claim has not been meaningfully confirmed.</p><h2><strong>Who Was Kevin Samuels Girlfriend Before His Death?</strong></h2><p>Kevin died on May 5, 2022, however, he was romantically linked to a few women in the latter days of his life. As discussed earlier, even on the day he died, he was with a woman who called 911 to report that he collapsed. In all, it is hard to tell if he was in a serious relationship when he died.</p><p>It was certain though that he was interested in getting married again. He stated this in a 2021 interview. Around the same time, it was speculated that <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>he was dating famous American fitness model, Brittany Renner</a>. The rumor started when the late YouTuber showed that the model was with him during one of his live streams.</p><p>The previous year, he was also romantically linked to another Instagram model who was rumored to be married, however, it was never certain if he was dating anyone just before he died. As stated earlier, Kevin was particular about keeping his private life private.</p><h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><h3><strong>Who was Kevin Samuels’s wife?</strong></h3><p>The identity of Kevin Samuels’s wife is unknown, as he did not share such information with the public before passing away.</p><h3><strong>What was Kevin Samuels’s wife’s age?</strong></h3><p>Kevin Samuels’s wife’s age is unknown as her identity is not known to the public.</p><h3><strong>Who was Kevin Samuels’s Second Ex-wife?</strong></h3><p>The identity of Kevin Smauels’s second ex-wife is not public knowledge.</p><h3><strong>Who was Kevin Samuels’s New Girlfriend at the Time of his Death?</strong></h3><p>Kevin Samuels was reportedly dating social media star and fitness model Brittany Renner before he passed away.</p><h3><strong>Was Kevin Samuels Gay?</strong></h3><p>Kevin Samuels was not gay.
