She had her first two children with her high school sweetheart, Corey Jackson. Her last two children were with her former fiance, Kevin Federline.</strong></p><p>Being a mother hasn’t been a seamless journey for the American actress and singer. It has been a learning experience for her, as exemplified in the Lifetime reality television series, <i>The Mother/Daughter Experiment: Celebrity Edition.&nbsp;</i>Alongside her eldest daughter Cassalei, Shar was among the six mother-and-daughter pairs who were featured on the show in a bid to&nbsp;repair their broken relationship with the help of therapist Dr. Debbie Magids.</p><h2><strong>How Many Kids Does Shar Jackson Have with Kevin Federline?</strong></h2><p>Shar Jackson has two kids with Kevin Federline. A son and a daughter, respectively, named Kori Madison Federline and Kaleb Michael Jackson Federline. Kevin Federline is an American dancer, actor, rapper, and other things, but he is known to many as the ex-husband of the Princess of Pop, Britney Spears.</p><p>He was married to the globally-acclaimed singer from 2004 to 2007, and they had two sons together named Jayden James Federline and Sean Preston Federline.</p><p>Before the Princess of Pop, Shar Jackson was the special woman in Kevin Federline’s life. They were together for about four years, from 2001 to 2004. Shar Jackson and Kevin Federline were engaged and expecting their second child together when their relationship packed up.</p><p>It was a rough time for Shar as it was clear that Kevin was leaving her and their unborn child for Britney. But over the years, Shar and Kevin have patched things up and are equally committed to caring for their kids to the best of their abilities.</p><h2><strong>Meet Shar Jackson’s Kids With Kevin Federline</strong></h2><h3><strong>Kori Madison Federline</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of Birth: </strong>July 31, 2002</li><li><strong>Age:&nbsp;</strong>21 years old</li><li><strong>Father: </strong>Kevin Federline</li><li><strong>Occupation:&nbsp;</strong>Artist</li></ul><p>Kori Madison Federline is the second daughter and third child of Shar Jackson and her first with Kevin Federline. Kori is the first of Kevin’s six children. She was born on the 31st of July 2002, and according to reports, her place of birth was in Yorba Linda, California, U.S. Given her date of birth, she is 21 years old at the moment.</p><p>This means her mother was a month shy of celebrating her 26th birthday when she was born. Shar was born on the 31st of August 1976 and is currently 47 years old. On the other hand, her father was 24 years old when she was born. Kevin was born on the 21st of March 1978 and is 45 years old right now.</p><p>Kori’s birth sign is Leo. Those who believe that the zodiac defines people’s behavior would expect of Kori to have a magnetic personality. Leos are said to be friendly, creative, and natural trendsetters. The spotlight has always been on Kori and her siblings, and this made their parents quite protective of them.</p><p>As such, the schools she has attended thus far are not known to the public. But based on her age, one could guess that she is in college at the moment. Kori is yet to have a defined career path, but she describes herself as an artist. Her former stepmother Britney Spears once took to Instagram to <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">celebrate</a> Kori for being a talented artist.</p><p>While her parents are no longer married, Kori and her younger brother have a good relationship with their father, Kevin Federline. He has always been involved in their lives, and their mother has attested to that several times.</p><h3><strong>Kaleb Michael Jackson Federline</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of Birth: </strong>July 31, 2002</li><li><strong>Age:&nbsp;</strong>21 years old</li><li><strong>Father: </strong>Kevin Federline</li><li><strong>Occupation:&nbsp;</strong>Unknown</li></ul><p>Kaleb Michael Jackson Federline is the younger brother of Kori and her only full sibling. He is the second son and youngest child of Shar Jackson. While he is Shar’s second child with Kevin Federline, he is Kevin’s first son and the second of his six children. This means Kaleb and Kori have a total of six half-siblings: two each from their parents’ relationships with other partners.</p><p>From their mother’s previous relationship, they have a step-sister and step-brother named Cassalei Monique and Donovan Jackson. They also have two step-brothers (Jayden James and Sean Preston Federline) from their father’s marriage with Britney Spears and two step-sisters from their father’s current marriage with Victoria Prince, one of whom is named Peyton Marie Federline.</p><p>Born on the 20th of July 2004 in Yorba Linda, California, Kaleb is 21 years old. He has finished high school and getting set for college. Thanks to their parents, Kaleb and his older sister Kori are Americans of multi-racial ethnicity. From their father’s side, they are of German, Irish, Scottish, English, and Italian descent. And from their mother’s side, they have a mixed&nbsp;African American and Puerto Rican heritage.</p><h2><strong>Meet Shar Jackson’s Children With Corey Jackson</strong></h2><h3><strong>Cassalei “Cassie” Monique Jackson</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of Birth: </strong>September 20, 1994</li><li><strong>Age:&nbsp;</strong>29 years old</li><li><strong>Father:&nbsp;</strong>Corey Jackson</li><li><strong>Occupation:&nbsp;</strong>Television Personality</li></ul><p>Cassie Monique Jackson is the first daughter and second child of Shar Jackson. Shar had Cassie and her older brother Donovan with her former partner, Corey Jackson. According to some reports, Corey and Shar were high school sweethearts. Other accounts suggest they were married for three years, from 1992 to 1995. Details of their relationship are sketchy, but it is no secret they gave birth to Cassie on the 20th of September 1994.</p><p>The 29-year-old Cassie is a television personality. Over the years, she has been seen in TV shows like Life After (2010), Hollywood Today Live (2016), and Naked and Afraid of Love (2021). Much isn’t known about her biological father, and it is hard to tell if she has a good relationship with him.</p><p>Cassie and her mother have had a rocky relationship, but they have been striving to work it out. In 2016, they appeared in an episode of <i>The Mother/Daughter Experiment: Celebrity Edition.&nbsp;</i>This was intended to <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">mend</a> their relationship as Cassie deemed her mother to be over-protective.</p><p>Cassie and her mother might have had their differences, but they get along and love each other. Through her, Shar is a grandmother. Cassie and her former boyfriend, Christoper Massy, have a daughter named Mariah Massey. She was born on the 25th of January 2015 and is currently 8 years old.</p><h3><strong>Donovan “Donnie” Antonio Jackson</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of Birth: </strong>June 23, 1993</li><li><strong>Age:&nbsp;</strong>30 years old</li><li><strong>Father:&nbsp;</strong>Corey Jackson</li><li><strong>Occupation:&nbsp;</strong>Unknown</li></ul><p>Donnie Jackson is the first son and eldest child of Shar Jackson. She had him with her former partner Corey Jackson. Donnie was born somewhere in California, United States, on the 23rd of June 1993. He is 30 years old at the moment. This means his mother, Shar, was only 16 years old when he was born.</p><p>Donnie is the least famous among Shar Jackson’s children. What he does for a living is not known, and it is hard to tell anything about him outside of the fact that he is Shar’s first child.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571KxmrKCRp3qrrcKkqqimXZ7Abq2MpqatoJWnerCyjG1kpaemmrm6ecKhoKWcopq7brnEnqtmrJiaunA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./shaun-morgan.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Shaun Morgan Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family">&larr;
