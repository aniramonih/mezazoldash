Sean Paul debuted in the music industry in 2000, when he released his first studio album entitled “Stage One”, which featured guest appearances from Mr. Vegas, Tony Matterhorn, and Luga Man among others. Upon its release, “Stage One” peaked at #2 on the Top Reggae Albums chart, and enjoyed a #98 spot on the Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums chart. A mixture of dancehall and reggae, “Stage One” produced one single under the name of “Deport Them”, which brought Sean Paul the most commercial success. The song peaked at #80 on the Billboard music chart and was later featured in <a href=#>John Singleton’s</a> film called “2 Fast 2 Furious”, starring <a href=#>Tyrese Gibson</a>, <a href=#>Paul Walker</a> and <a href=#>Eva Mendes</a>.</p><p>Up to date, Sean Paul has released 5 studio albums, the latest one being “Full Frequency”, which features songs with <a href=#>Nicki Minaj</a>, <a href=#>2 Chainz</a> and <a href=#>Juicy J</a> to name a few, and has released one mixtape entitled “The Odyssey Mixtape”, which includes collaborations with <a href=#>Chris Brown</a>, <a href=#>Lil Jon</a> and <a href=#>Sean Kingston</a>.</p><p>Prior to his breakthrough in the music industry, in 1998, Sean Paul debuted in an acting role in Hype Williams’ film called “Belly”, where he co-starred alongside <a href=#>DMX</a>, <a href=#>Nas</a>, <a href=#>Method Man</a> and T-Boz.</p><p>A well-known rapper, as well as an actor, how rich is Sean Paul? According to sources, Sean Paul’s net worth is estimated to be $12 million. Most of Sean Paul’s net worth and wealth comes from his involvement in the entertainment industry.</p><h3>Sean Paul Net Worth $12 Million</h3><p>Sean Paul was born in 1973, in Kingston, Jamaica, where he studied at the Wolmers High School for Boys, before transferring to Hillel Academy High School. Sean Paul then enrolled in the University of Technology, with future prospects of finding a career in hotel management. Sean Paul’s plans changed when he met Jeremy Harding, who would later become his manager. With Harding’s help, Paul managed to become known locally and as his fame expanded, he made an appearance in “Belly” and shortly afterwards released his debut album. Two years later, in 2002, Sean Paul came out with “Dutty Rock”, his second studio album, which produced such popular singles as “Gimmie the Light”, “Get Busy” and “Like Glue”. However, the song that brought him the most public exposure was a collaboration with <a href=#>Beyoncé</a> called “Baby Boy”. The song stayed on top of the music charts for 9 weeks in a row and was well-received by both critics and the audience. “Dutty Rock” managed to peak at #9 on the Billboard 200 music chart and sell more than 65 000 during its debut week. Eventually, Sean Paul’s second album went on to sell more than 6 million copies around the world, and helped him become a recognized face in the music industry. Over the years, Sean Paul had an opportunity to work with such artists as <a href=#>Rihanna</a>, <a href=#>Akon</a>, <a href=#>Snoop Dogg</a>, <a href=#>Enrique Iglesias</a>, <a href=#>Busta Rhymes</a> and <a href=#>Shaggy</a> among others.</p><p>A well-known rap artist, Sean Paul has an estimated net worth of $11 million.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=36.922423556059><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Sean Paul</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$12 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>January 8, 1973</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Kingston, Jamaica</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 8 in (1.73 m)</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Profession</td><td>Singer, Musician, Songwriter, Actor, Rapper, Record producer</td></tr><tr readability=13><td>Education</td><td>Wolmer's Schools, University Of Technology, Jamaica, No Lie, She Doesn't Mind, I'm Still in Love with You, Ocho Rios, Jamaica, Stockholm, Sweden, Denmark</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>Jamaica</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Jodi Stewart (m. 2012)</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Parents</td><td>Garth Henriques, Frances Henriques, No Lie, She Doesn't Mind, I'm Still in Love with You</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Siblings</td><td>Jason "Jigzagula" Henriques</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Nicknames</td><td>Sean Paul Henriques , Paul, Sean , Sean Paul Ryan Francis Henriques , Sean da Paul , Beyoncé & Sean Paul</td></tr><tr readability=0.4><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/seanpaul</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.35897435897436><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/duttypaul</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.41860465116279><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.instagram.com/duttypaul</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.36842105263158><td>MySpace</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.myspace.com/seanpaul</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm1391062</a></td></tr><tr readability=10><td>Awards</td><td>Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album, American Music Award for Favorite Pop/Rock Male Artist, MTV Europe Music Award for Best New Act, Soul Train Music Award for Best Reggae Artist, MuchMusic Video Award for iHeartRadio International Artist of the Year, Soul Train Music Award for Best Caribbean Perfor...</td></tr><tr readability=12><td>Nominations</td><td>Grammy Award for Best New Artist, Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance, MTV Video Music Award for Best Electronic Video, MTV Video Music Award for Best Choreography, MTV Europe Music Award for Best Male, MTV Europe Music Award for Best Song, MTV Europe Music Award for Best Hip-Hop, Brit A...</td></tr><tr readability=13><td>Movies</td><td>Sean Paul: Duttyology, Notarized: Year End Video Countdown, Reggae Sting: 20th Anniversary, It's All About Dancing: A Jamaican Dance-U-Mentary, Sting 2002, 2001 Reggae Sting, Blow!
