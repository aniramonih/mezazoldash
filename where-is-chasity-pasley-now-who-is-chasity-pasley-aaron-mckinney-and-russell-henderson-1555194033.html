At the time, Pasley was the live-in girlfriend of Russell Henderson, one of the accused in the case. During the trial of Aaron McKinney, the other accused party, Pasley testified as a prosecution witness.</p><p>In her emotional testimony, Pasley revealed that she learned about the attack on Shepard when she overheard McKinney and Henderson discussing it. She also disclosed how she had assisted in covering up the crime. Pasley, Henderson, and McKinney's girlfriend, Kristen Price, disposed of the evidence, including Henderson's bloodied clothing and expensive shoes worn on the night of the attack.</p><p>Pasley's testimony provided crucial insight into the post-attack events, including attempts to hide evidence and mislead the police. Her involvement in the cover-up was a significant aspect of the trial, shedding light on the actions of those connected to the crime.</p><h2>Aaron Mckinney and Russell Henderson</h2><p>Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson were the perpetrators of the brutal murder of Matthew Shepard in 1998, an event widely regarded as one of the most notorious anti-gay hate crimes in American history. McKinney and Henderson pistol-whipped, beat, tied to a fence in freezing conditions, and set fire to Shepard before leaving him to die.</p><p>Their heinous act led to a significant national backlash against hyper-macho culture and homophobia, resulting in positive changes for the LGBTQ+ community. McKinney and Henderson were convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison. However, they were not charged with a hate crime due to Wyoming's criminal law at the time.</p><p>In recent years, investigative journalist Stephen Jimenez's book, "The Book of Matt," has challenged the perception that Shepard's murder was solely a hate crime. Jimenez's research suggests that drug use, particularly crystal meth, may have played a role in the crime and that Shepard had a more complex relationship with one of his attackers, Aaron McKinney, than initially believed. This perspective has sparked controversy and raised questions about the motivations behind the murder.</p><br><br><h2 class=faq_title>Where is Chasity Pasley Now: FAQs</h2>1.
