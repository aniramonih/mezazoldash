The son of reggae legend Bob Marley, he led the family band Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers until 2002, and then began a successful career as a solo artist on his own record label, Tuff Gong Worldwide. Beyond music, he is heavily involved in philanthropy, and in 2007 founded the charity foundation U.R.G.E. to help children in disadvantaged areas around the world.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Ziggy Marley was born as David Marley on October 17, 1968 in Kingston, Jamaica as the eldest son of reggae legend <a href=#>Bob Marley</a> and his wife <a href=#>Rita Marley</a>, a fellow singer-songwriter. His siblings are Stephen, Julian, Ky-mani, Robert Jr., Rohan, Damian, Sharon, Cedella, Karen, Stephanie, and Serita. Marley grew up in both Kingston, Jamaica and Wilmington, Delaware, attending elementary school for a few years in the latter city. Surrounded by music as a child, he took guitar and drum lessons from his father and sat in on his father's recording sessions. With some of his classmates, Marley formed a singing group called the Seven Do Bees. He also played with his brother Stephen at some of their father's bigger concerts in the late 1970s.</p><h2 id=ziggy-marley-melody-makers><strong>Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers</strong></h2><p>In 1979, Marley and his siblings Stephen, Sharon, and Cedella founded the reggae band Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers, named after the British weekly music magazine Melody Maker. They went on to make their recording debut with the song "Children Playing in the Streets," which was written for them by their father. Royalties from the single went to the United Nations. The Melody Makers released their debut album, "Play the Game Right," in 1985. That was followed by "Hey World!" in 1986. The group's commercial breakthrough came in 1988 with the album "Conscious Party," which launched the popular songs "Tumblin' Down" and "Tomorrow People" and won the Grammy Award for Best Reggae Recording. The Melody Makers won a second consecutive Grammy for Best Reggae Recording for the album "One Bright Day." Further nominations came in the 1990s for "Jahmekya," "Joy and Blues," and "Free Like We Want 2 B," followed by a Grammy win in 1997 for "Fallen is Babylon." Closing out the decade, the Melody Makers released "Spirit of Music," their final studio album before their disbanding in 2002.</p><h2 id=solo-career><strong>Solo Career</strong></h2><p>After the disbanding of the Melody Makers, Marley embarked on a solo career.

That year, he released "Love is My Religion," which won him his fourth career Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album.
