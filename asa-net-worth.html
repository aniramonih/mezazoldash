With an impressive net worth of $1.5 million, Asa is one of the <a href=# rel=noopener>richest female musicians in Nigeria</a>. In this article, <a href=# rel=noopener>RNN</a> details Asa’s net worth, career, and achievements.</p><h2>Bio Data</h2><table width=782><tbody><tr><td><strong>Full Name</strong></td><td>Bukola Elemide</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Popularly known as</strong></td><td>Aṣa</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Date of Birth</strong></td><td>September 17, 1982</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Gender</strong></td><td>Female</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Marital Status</strong></td><td>Single</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Career</strong></td><td>Singer, Songwriter, and Recording Artist</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Asa Net worth&nbsp;</strong></td><td>$1-5 Million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nationality&nbsp;</strong></td><td>Nigerian-French</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Biography</h2><p>Bukola Elemide, popularly known as Asa, is a Nigerian-French singer and songwriter. She was born on the 17th of September 1982 when her parents were working and studying cinematography in France. Her parents are Nigerians who hail from Itoku, Abeokuta South LGA in Ogun State.</p><p>Asa is the only girl among her three brothers. At the tender age of two, her family made the move back to Nigeria, where she spent much of her upbringing in Lagos.</p><p>It wasn’t until 18 years later, when Asa returned to Paris, that she embarked on her music journey. Drawing inspiration from her father’s eclectic music collection, featuring luminaries like Fela Kuti, Marvin Gaye, and Nina Simone, she cultivated her distinct style, blending Pop, Jazz, and Indie Pop.</p><h2>Music Career</h2><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/rnn.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Asa.webp alt="Asa Net Worth and Biography" width=770 height=513 sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>As earlier mention, Asa’s music taste was influenced by the music collection her father played while growing up. He had these collections from practicing as a cinematographer.</p><p>Her musical odyssey took a significant turn when she attended Peter King’s School of Music in Nigeria. In a remarkably short span of six months, she mastered the art of playing the guitar. This newfound skill propelled her into the spotlight.</p><p>In 2004, a pivotal meeting with songwriter and producer Cobhams Emmanuel Asuquo, arranged by her manager and confidante Janet Nwose, marked a turning point in her career. Cobhams took the reins as the producer of her debut studio album, aptly titled ‘Asa.’</p><p>At the young age of 20, Asa returned to France, enrolling in the IMFP school of Jazz music. To her astonishment, her teachers recognized her immense talent and advised her to focus on her recordings, deeming further schooling unnecessary.</p><p>At the time, her first single; ‘<strong>Eyé Adaba’</strong> (meaning ‘dove’) which she released when she was still in Nigeria was already having airplay. This poignant track resonated deeply, resonating with audiences worldwide and gaining widespread acclaim.</p><p>This triumph led to her signing with Naive Records, and with the collaborative efforts of Cobhams, Christopher Dupuoy, and Benjamin Constant, her eponymous album ‘Asa’ achieved platinum status.</p><p>On her second album, Beautiful Imperfection, she collaborated with French composer, Nicolas Mollard. It was released on the 25th of October 2010 and it went platinum in 2011. By 2014, she had sold up to 400,000 albums worldwide.</p><p>Thereafter, she has released a number of singles and albums that have also broken records. Asa is not very big on features but in 2022, she released an album, “V” where she featured Wizkid, Cavemen, and Amaarae.</p><p>In an interview, Asa disclosed that she considers Angelique Kidjo her mentor, underscoring the profound influence of this iconic figure on her musical journey.</p><p>Asa’s trajectory from her early days in Nigeria to becoming the wealthiest female musician in Nigeria is a testament to her exceptional talent, unwavering dedication, and the invaluable mentorship she’s received along the way.</p><h2>Asa Net Worth</h2><p>While we can not independently verify the singer’s net worth, various online sources estimate Asa’s net worth to be between the range of $1 to $5 million, making her one of the <a href=# rel=noopener>richest female musicians in Nigeria</a>.</p><h2>Is Asa Married?</h2><p>No. Asa is not married.</p><p>However, the singer did reveal her plans to get married in an interview with Bolanle Olukanni in 2020.</p><p>According to her, she was unmarried at 36 because she grew “selfish” with herself and her time.</p><p>Considering that Asa is quite a private celebrity, information about her recent marital status is not available online.</p><h2>Awards</h2><p>Below are the awards Asa has won in her career:</p><ul><li>2008: Headies Album of the year</li><li>2012: French Music Awards Victoires de la Musique nomination for “Female Artist of the Year”.</li></ul><h2>Recommended Articles</h2><ul><li><a href=#>Tems Net Worth And Biography</a></li><li><a href=#>Top 20 Richest Musicians In Nigeria and Their Net Worth</a></li><li><a href=# rel=noopener>Richest Female Rappers And Their Net Worth</a></li><li><a href=#>Top 20 Richest Musicians in the World</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiqnqN7r7OOmqqaZZ6awW7DzquroWc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./bar-refaeli-looks-radiant-in-boho-wedding-gown-with-sheer-skirt-2015309.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bar Refaeli Looks Radiant in Boho Wedding Gown With Sheer Skirt">&larr;
