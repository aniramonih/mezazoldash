Ash went to art school and Murphy went to work in a printing factory. They met up again five years later and Ash suggested forming a band. Rigging up a makeshift rehearsal space, Ash played an Echo 12 – bar blues, while Murphy sang a series of newspaper articles. Four weeks later, they formed Bauhaus and recorded "Bela Lugosi's Dead".</p><p>In June 2009, Ash released a cover of the <a href=#>David Essex</a> song "Rock On", featuring singer Zak Ambrose on vocals. Recorded at the Swing House rehearsal and recording complex in Hollywood, the track is on the Swing House Sessions Vol 1 EP. Later in 2009, Ash released a four song EP exclusively through iTunes, entitled "It's A Burn Out".</p><p>In 2008, Bauhaus released Go Away White, (their first studio album in 25 years) which was followed by a world tour.</p><p>Love and Rockets last played at Coachella Music and Arts Festival in 2008.</p><p>After nearly five years of recording and performing, Bauhaus broke up and Ash put together Tones on Tail with Bauhaus drummer <a href=#>Kevin Haskins</a>. As Ash described them: "We were a motley crew of individuals who essentially wanted to sound like a band from Venus or Mars!" In 1984, Tones on Tail was disbanded; Ash founded Love and Rockets in 1985 with Haskins and David J, also of Bauhaus. In an interview in June 2009, Ash emphatically stated that he had no further plans to play with Love and Rockets.</p><p>That song, released in 1979, became one of the most influential songs in gothic rock music, even though they saw themselves as a "dark glam" band and have always distanced themselves from the gothic label. From early on, he was intent on sounding original, and often tried to "make the guitar not sound like a guitar". He worked to develop a guitar style that included other-worldly and atmospheric sounds by the use of an EBow. He typically has used a Telecaster guitar, HH amplifiers and Marshall 4x12 cabinets for his stage gear. Later in his career, he relied heavily on the Fernandes Sustainer system to achieve sounds similar to the EBow.</p><p>Daniel Gaston Ash (born 31 July 1957 in Northampton, England) is an English musician, songwriter and singer. He became prominent in the late 1970s as the guitarist for the iconic goth rock band Bauhaus, which spawned two related bands led by Ash: Tones on Tail and Love and Rockets. Recently, he reunited with bandmate <a href=#>Kevin Haskins</a> to form Poptone, a retrospective of their respective careers, featuring Kevin's daughter Diva Dompe on bass. He has also recorded several solo albums. Several guitarists have listed Ash as an influence, including <a href=#>Dave Navarro</a> of Jane's Addiction, <a href=#>Kim Thayil</a> of Soundgarden and <a href=#>John Frusciante</a> of the Red Hot Chili Peppers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfma6vtcSlZJqrmA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./do-you-need-underlayment-for-smartcore-ultra-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Do you need underlayment for Smartcore Ultra?">&larr;
