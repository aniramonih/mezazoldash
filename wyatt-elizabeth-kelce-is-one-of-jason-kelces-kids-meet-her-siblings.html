Aside from Wyatt, the NFL star and his wife, Kylie McDevitt, are proud parents of two other children, Elliotte Ray and Bennett Llewellyn.&nbsp;</p><p>Jason plays center for the Philadelphia Eagles. He has been a part of the team since they drafted him in the sixth round of the 2011 NFL draft.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Jasonn.jpg><p>Jason is, quite simply, good at what he does. He spends most of his time training but ensures his life as a sports star does not interfere with his relationship with his children. Thus when the mountain of a man is not on the field, he can be found with a baby in one hand and another across his shoulder.&nbsp;</p><p>Wyatt Elizabeth Kelce is the first child and daughter of NFL star Jason Kelce and his supportive wife, Kylie McDevitt. She was <a href=#>born</a> on October 2, 2019, one day after her father was excused from training.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Fammily-1-1-1.jpg><p>The proud father celebrated her arrival with a picture on his Instagram page. The photo captured Kylie holding their newborn, who looked like she was making a peace sign,&nbsp;against her chest.&nbsp;</p><p>He <a href=#>captioned </a>the post: “Chunked up the Deuces on her way out. Wyatt Elizabeth Kelce 10/2/2019 8lbs 6oz.”&nbsp;</p><p>In December 2019, the couple and little Wyatt attended her first game, where the Eagles faced off against the Dallas Cowboys. Kylie shared a moment from the occasion on her Instagram page.&nbsp;</p><p>She <a href=#>wrote</a>:</p><p>“Wyatt got to experience her first Dallas sucks chant yesterday… it was a proud mom moment.”&nbsp;</p><p>Wyatt has also been known to cheer for her uncle Travis who plays with the Kansas City Chiefs. She and her mother watched the match that won the Chiefs the Super Bowl in 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>Wyatt likes the team, but like her father, the Eagles are the club she is perpetually rooting for. After the team won against the New York Giants in January 2023, Jason posted cute footage of Wyatt cheering for them as soon as she woke up.</p><p>The proud father <a href=#>captioned </a>the post: “Apparently Wyatt is pretty pumped about the Eagles win last night too. Woke up to her singing the entire fight song this morning in her crib.”</p><p>Wyatt also cheered for her father’s team in this year’s Super Bowl. Although the Eagles did not win, the little girl had great fun.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Fans_Reacted_to_Wyatt_Elizabeth_Kelces_Birth></span>How Fans Reacted to Wyatt Elizabeth Kelce’s Birth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Wyatt is the child who made Jason Kelce a father for the first time. So, when it was announced that she had been born, his fans went wild with their <a href=#>reactions</a>.</p><p>Fans of the Eagles on Twitter wasted no time asking if she could play corner and photoshopped his famous Mummer’s garb onto the gorgeous little girl.</p><p>There were a lot of congratulatory messages, and some people pointed out how “crazy” it was to be born to the “best center in the league.” Others were more focused on Wyatt’s name. Some thought giving a female child such a name was not good enough, but that didn’t change her parents’ minds.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Wyatt_Elizabeth_Kelces_Siblings></span>Wyatt Elizabeth Kelce’s Siblings&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Wyatt has two siblings. The first is Elliotte Ray Kelce, born on March 4, 2021.&nbsp;Her birth pleased her parents, and in the following months, Kylie posted many sweet pictures of her on Instagram.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Super-Bowl-Jason-Kelce-reveals-he-had-to-sneak-his-1.jpg><p>Like her sister, Elliotte is also turning out to be a big fan of football. In August 2022, she and Wyatt joined their father on the field for a family photo that saw them posing in Eagles attire.</p><p>Wyatt’s second sibling is Kylie, and Jason’s third daughter, Bennett Llewellyn Kelce. She was born on February 23, 2023.</p><p>She arrived months after Kylie revealed that she and Jason were expecting a third child.&nbsp;At the Super Bowl LVII, where she watched her husband battle his brother, Travis’s Kansas City Chiefs, Kylie was 38 weeks along.</p><p>Kylie was fully prepared to enter labor during the big game, as she traveled with two OBs and an emergency delivery plan. She and her husband had plans to give their daughter a name that would pay tribute to the Super Bowl if Bennett had shown up on the match day, but that didn’t happen.&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, the pair chose to honor Jason’s grandmother by giving their third child her middle name, Llewellyn. With three daughters and a wife, Jason has many female cheerleaders who will cheer him on through every win and loss in his NFL career.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks to his talent and passion for the sport, Jason is one of those expected to reach the summit of the game and then retire like many other <a href=#>NFL stars</a> before him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kxLqt061knqSZr66jsdOhZKSdnJiybrXSZqannV2ks262wKymp2WbmrmksdJmoqKco2K6prHTZp%2Beql2otqO4yKeerGc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./yella-beezy-net-worth-2020-2021.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Yella Beezy Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Dating, Bio-Wiki">&larr;
