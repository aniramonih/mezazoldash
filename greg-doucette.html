He is best renowned for his bodybuilding and fitness videos, as well as his various athletic accomplishments.</h3><h2>The net worth of Greg Doucette:</h2><p>Greg Doucette has an estimated net worth of <strong>$1 million</strong> as of late 2020, owing to his long career as a weightlifter, bodybuilder, and YouTube content developer.</p><h2>Childhood</h2><p>Although little is known about Greg Austin Doucette’s family, it is known that he has a twin brother. Greg’s main education is unknown, but he has stated that he graduated from Acadia University with a major in Kinesiology and then went on to earn a Master’s degree at St. Francis Xavier in Antigonish, Nova Scotia.<br>Greg grew obsessed with lifting big objects as a seven-year-old child, and he copied professional Olympic weightlifters. He and his twin brother began training under their father’s supervision at that time. Despite the fact that their instruments were only iron itches and cement blocks, it was enough to turn Greg’s boyhood pleasure into a love. Greg has stated multiple times that spending time with his family was one of his favourite things to do as a child and that it was<strong> “one of my happiest memories growing up.”</strong></p><p>Greg found bodybuilding was a legitimate profession after witnessing several athletes on a television show when he was 13 years old, and he knew it was what he wanted to pursue.</p><h2>Career:</h2><h2><strong>The First Steps</strong></h2><p>Greg Doucette, who began training with homemade heavy objects at a young age, was able to begin competing in professional events throughout his adolescence; the first competitions he entered when he was just 14 years old were bench press events, where he easily outperformed his adult competitors.</p><p>Greg won his first junior bodybuilding competition when he was <strong>17 years old,</strong> and he also competed in other weightlifting contests. When he initially won one of these contests, he set a national record by lifting <strong>382 pounds.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Greg-Doucette-1-300x300.jpg><p>Greg Doucette idolized Jeff Becker as a rookie in the powerlifting scene, but throughout his time participating in bench press events, he was highly influenced by John Fraser as well, telling Critical Bench: ‘he had a fantastic bench and had a muscular physique like me.’</p><h2>Accomplishments</h2><ul><li>Greg Doucette has competed in various international contests and has world records in bodybuilding and powerlifting.<br>In 2011, he was the World Powerlifting Congress (WPC) champion in the 90kg weight class. He also broke the Masters Raw bench press record by lifting<strong> 529 pounds.</strong></li><li>In addition to competing in almost 60 powerlifting contests, Greg Doucette entered the<strong> World Record Guinness Book Sumo Deadlifting</strong> category in <strong>2015</strong> by lifting <strong>182.6kgs fifty times</strong>, eventually setting a record of <strong>9,130kgs</strong> lifted in total.</li><li>Greg confessed that setting a Guinness World Record was a goal he set for himself as a child: <strong>‘I am 40 years old, and only weigh 210 pounds, yet I was able to achieve my objective with 30 years of hard work, persistence, and dedication.’</strong></li><li>Greg’s bodybuilding career has also given him worldwide attention, with the International Federation of Bodybuilding and Fitness (IFBB) awarding him a Pro Card in 2012.<br>In the same year, he won the Canadian National Light Heavyweight Championship.</li><li>Following these significant achievements in his career, Greg finished ninth in the 2016 Bodybuilding competition at the IFBB ProShow in Toronto. In 2019, he was ranked ninth in Germany by the IFBB and fourth in the Classic Physique competition.</li></ul><h2>YouTube</h2><p>Greg Doucette launched his own YouTube channel in <strong>2007</strong> and began uploading short videos of his training routines to the network. However, in <strong>2013</strong>, he began to shift his content in a different direction, producing longer videos in which he expressed his opinions and knowledge about bodybuilding and weightlifting.</p><p>Greg has caused a number of issues over the years by publicly criticizing other weightlifters and competitors. Despite this, his fan base has been continuously rising.</p><p>Greg currently has over <strong>800,000 members</strong>, most of them are young men who are motivated by Greg’s own profession or who are looking for advice about working out and growing their physique.</p><h2>Cycling</h2><p>Despite being well-known in the powerlifting and fitness communities, Greg Doucette’s professional career has not been as fruitful. Greg began professional biking in 2017 and began competing in professional competitions the following year. His career in this sport, however, was cut short when he was suspended following the Tour of Keji, a bicycle race held in Nova Scotia, in which he finished 11th in his category. He was asked to submit a test for anti-doping purposes after the tournament. Greg – who supposedly had no idea the race was being investigated by the Canadian Anti-doping Program – refused to allow the test to be administered and was thus suspended, since it was judged that he was in violation of the rules.<br>Doucette was supposedly receiving testosterone injections at the time of the race due to his body’s lack of the said hormone, which was caused by his extensive usage of PED (physical enhancing drugs) during his bodybuilding years. Despite the fact that these injections were administered on the advice of a doctor, the race did not permit its participants to take such medications.</p><p>Despite Greg Doucette’s assertions that he was unaware of the rules, the suspension was not lifted, and he is now barred from competing in professional cycling races for a period of ten years.</p><h2>Steroids?</h2><p>Greg Doucette’s suspension at the Tour of Keji was not his first run-in with anti-doping authorities; <strong>he tested positive for the metabolite Boldenone Undecylenate in 2009.</strong><br>Concerning this low point in his career, Doucette denied he had&nbsp;<u><a href=# rel=nofollow>consumed said substance</a></u>: ‘This is very devastating news, as many people will believe that all my past lifting performances over the last 11 years of competition were a result of banned substances.”</p><p>Greg claimed that he had always tested negative for drugs during previous tournaments and that the drug found in his system didn’t make sense because it would have slowed his progress rather than accelerated it: ‘Dieting is difficult enough without taking something to boost your appetite,’ he remarked, referring to the anabolic <strong>steroid’s adverse effects</strong>. Greg was <strong>suspended for two years,</strong> beginning in <strong>January 2010.</strong></p><h2>Arrest</h2><p>Greg Doucette was <strong>arrested in 2012</strong> for being in possession of over<strong> $250,000 in steroids.</strong><br>He was also charged with smuggling and trafficking in the aforementioned chemicals. The medicines are said to have originated in the Philippines, Thailand, and China. The discovery of these chemicals was regarded as one of the largest steroid seizures in Canadian history. Doucette was <u><a href=# rel=nofollow>charged for these crimes</a></u> and sentenced to<strong> $50,000 in fines</strong> and <strong>20 months on probation.</strong></p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p><strong>Allyson Smith</strong> is Greg Doucette’s girlfriend. It is uncertain when the couple began dating, but they allegedly met through weightlifting, as Allyson not only competes in this sort of competition but also <strong>holds a world record in Raw Powerlifting.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Greg-Doucette-300x300.jpg><h2>Physical Measurements</h2><p>Greg Doucette appears to be a well-built man with dark brown hair and eyes. He stands <strong>5ft 6ins (1.68m)</strong> tall and weighs about <strong>195lbs (88kgs).</strong></p><h2>Interesting Facts on Greg Doucette:</h2><li>Greg’s girlfriend, Allyson Smith, is a YouTuber as well.</li><li>Although Greg was motivated by other athletes at the outset of his career, he now considers himself to be his role model since he believes he wants to outperform himself rather than others.</li><li>He was featured as The 40-Year-Old Bodybuilder in a VICE series in 2017.</li><li>Greg’s website offers coach services as a weightlifter, and he has produced several publications. His favourite workout has always been the bench press.</li><li>He recently parted relations with the supplement company RYSE, which had been his sponsor for several years. He also stated that he is working on developing his own supplement brand, albeit no additional information regarding this venture has been revealed.</li><p>You may also like <a href=# rel=bookmark>Nikki Simpson, </a><a href=# rel=bookmark>Rick Salomon</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6XCra3Rp5ytr5%2Bnwal6wqikaJ%2BimrRusM6ump6spJp8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./haul-off-like-a-broken-down-automobile-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Haul off like a broken-down automobile">&larr;
