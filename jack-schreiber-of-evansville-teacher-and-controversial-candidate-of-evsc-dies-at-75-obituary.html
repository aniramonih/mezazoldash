Jack passed away at the age of 78, following a prolonged battle with heart disease. His passing on Friday, September 15, 2023, has left a void in the hearts of his loved ones and the community he served so diligently.</p><p>Born on July 6, 1945, in Evansville, Indiana, Jack B. Schriber was the son of the late Marvin and Dorothy (Coke) Schriber. He obtained his Bachelor of Arts and master’s degree from Bosse and the University of Evansville (UE). Additionally, Jack proudly served in the United States Army.</p><p>Jack’s commitment to education was unwavering. He served as a teacher of language arts and communications, leaving a lasting impact on his students. His dedication extended to Central High School, where he taught speech and language arts and directed plays.</p><p>In his role as Supervisor of Fine Arts in the Evansville Vanderburgh School Corporation (EVSC), Jack championed the arts in the local schools. He played a crucial role in the development of the EVSC summer musical and served as its Co-Producer for an impressive 25 years.</p><p>Jack’s passion for the arts extended beyond his professional life. He was deeply involved in various arts and cultural organizations in the community. He served as the president of the Arts Council of Southwestern Indiana and was a tireless advocate for the arts and artists.</p><p>His contributions to the community were diverse and impactful. Jack was a candidate for the Evansville City Council, a consultant for the EVSC, and an adjunct professor at the University of Southern Indiana (USI). He also lent his expertise to the UE, where he was known for his civic virtues and dedication to young people.</p><p>In recognition of his outstanding contributions, Jack received the Leadership Evansville Lifetime Achievement Award in 2014. He and his wife, Sue, were honored with the downtown Rotary Civic Award in 2009 for their lifetime achievements in service to Evansville.</p><p>Jack’s community involvement extended to various volunteer boards, including those of the Evansville Museum, the Evansville Philharmonic Orchestra, Friends of Art, Drama, and Music at UE, the USI Society for Arts and Humanities, Friends of the Victory Theatre, and Rotary. His civic engagement was a testament to his deep-rooted connection to the city he loved.</p><p>Jack’s influence reached beyond his professional and community roles. He was a close friend and advisor to Mayor Lloyd Winnecke and a dedicated member of the congregation at First Presbyterian Church, where he actively engaged with issues of faith and service.</p><p>Throughout his life, Jack remained deeply tied to his Evansville roots. He cherished the community and its people, tirelessly working to make a positive difference in their lives. Even in his retirement, he continued to contribute to his community by serving as a driver for Meals on Wheels and working for the Jacob Ball Wish Fund.</p><p>Jack’s ability to connect with people, find laughter in any situation, and make others feel valued and important endeared him to all who knew him. His legacy of service, civic engagement, and unwavering commitment to others will continue to inspire the Evansville community.</p><p>Jack Schreiber is survived by his loving wife of 50 years, Suzanne (Horne) Schriber; daughter, Tiffany (Schriber) Ball; grandson, Raegan Ball; nieces and nephews; and a host of friends and colleagues whose lives he touched.</p><p>A Celebration of Life to honor Jack Schreiber will be held at Noon on Tuesday, September 19, 2023, at First Presbyterian Church, 609 SE Second Street, Evansville, Indiana. The service will be officiated by Rev. Wendy McCormick and Rev. Anna von Winckler. Following the ceremony, he will be entombed at Alexander Memorial Park, where Military Rites will be performed. Friends may pay their respects on Monday from 2:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. at Alexander East Chapel and on Tuesday from 10:00 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. at First Presbyterian Church.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiin5fAo7vTrGWcp51kt6KvymaqnKCimrajsdFmpp9llauur7%2FVoqOlnV2psqKvx56pZpmemXqku82tqaiulafAqq3LZpqappSesaLAxGamn2WVq8CkecOinKxlkal6eIGMqJmirKWWv7p7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./james-mcvey-release-t-shirts-centrepoint-charity.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="James McVey To Release T-Shirts For Centrepoint Charity">&larr;
