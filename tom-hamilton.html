He first began playing guitar when his older brother Scott showed him his first chords at age 12.</p><p>Hamilton shifted to bass when he was 14 to join a local band because they had an open space at that position. He was in a few bands with soon-to-be Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry and David “Pudge” Scott.</p><p>One of the bands was simply named “The Jam Band”. It was at a Jam Band gig in summer 1970 at a place called “The Barn” in Sunapee, New Hampshire, that the Jam Band met Steven Tyler, and the four of them agreed to move to Boston to start a band (not yet named Aerosmith).</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-914 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>Scott left the group shortly thereafter, being replaced by Tyler on drums. The three became a power trio with Hamilton on bass, Perry on guitar, and Tyler on drums and vocals.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Then Ray Tabano joined and finally, Joey Kramer joined (who coined the name “Aerosmith”) in replacing Tyler on drums so he could concentrate on vocals. Tabano was replaced by Brad Whitford and Aerosmith was born.</p><h2>Tom Hamilton Bass</h2><p>Hamilton is the tallest member of the band at 6’1″. He is also the “funny one” of Aerosmith, always looking for opportunities to make jokes in interviews and also being one of the bigger talkers at interviews.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-915 data-method=placement-service></span><p>According to the band’s official website, Hamilton’s favorite song by the band is “The Farm” (from the 1997 album Nine Lives). He married Terry Cohen in 1975 and they have two children, Julian and Sage.</p><p>In August 2006, Hamilton stated that he was diagnosed with throat and tongue cancer and completed a seven-week course of radiation and chemotherapy. He was forced to miss Aerosmith’s Route of All Evil Tour. David Hull (who has played in the Joe Perry Project) filled in for him. He had never previously missed an Aerosmith show.</p><p>Hamilton joined the band for the performance of “Sweet Emotion” at their Boston show in September 2006, and at the private show at the Beacon Theatre in New York, on December 3, 2006, where he reclaimed his place with the band for the entire performance. On December 20, 2006, he reported on Aero Force One that he is cancer-free after a recent PET scan.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-916 data-method=placement-service></span><p>Hamilton underwent further surgery and did not play some of the Aerosmith/ZZ Top Tour and again, was replaced by David Hull. His cancer returned in 2011, and he has since been treated and is recovering. In April 2013, he was forced to retire from the band’s tour in Australia for health reasons. He returned to the US after contracting an infection in the chest region.</p><p>David Hull, who has replaced Hamilton in other tours of Aerosmith, took his place. Early in 2016, he was also announced as the new bassist for Thin Lizzy. Hamilton has stated that his favorite bassists are John Paul Jones, John Entwistle, and Paul McCartney.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><h2>Tom Hamilton Instruments</h2><p>Hamilton has used a wide variety of bass guitars over Aerosmith’s career. He has said in several interviews that his first bass was a Fender Precision that he borrowed and later bought from a friend.</p><p>During the early years of Aerosmith and the time after their reformation, Hamilton often used a Music Man bass, a Fender Precision Bass, a Fender Jazz Bass, or a Gibson Thunderbird.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-917 data-method=placement-service></span><p>During the “Dude Looks Like A Lady” sequence of Wayne’s World 2, Hamilton is seen playing a Gibson Les Paul bass. However, during the making of Just Push Play, he called upon a Hofner Violin Bass or a double bass during many of the recording sessions.</p><p>Recently Hamilton has favored a modified ’51 Fender Precision Bass with double pickups instead of one for the recording of Honkin’ On Bobo and the subsequent tours following the album’s creation.</p><p>It is known that Hamilton also uses Parker basses, since he appeared playing this bass in Guitar Hero: Aerosmith, though he was seen playing one at the 2004 concert in Japan. As of June 2009, he was touring with five Sadowsky basses in addition to others.</p><p>Hamilton has been playing G&L ASAT Basses for nearly twenty years since he bought his first blue metal flake, ASAT Bass, at 48th Street Custom Guitars in New York City.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-918 data-method=placement-service></span><p>Since then, G&L has built several more ASAT Basses in a variety of finishes, but there’s something about G&L’s over-the-top metal flake finishes that keeps him coming back for more. He has a signature G&L ASAT Bass model. He discusses his signature basses in rig rundowns most notably in 2012 on the Global Warming Tour.</p><h2>Tom Hamilton Illness</h2><p>Hamilton was initially diagnosed with throat cancer in 2006. After the disease went into remission, it returned in 2011. Recently he gave fans an update on his health.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><p>According to The Pulse Of Radio, Hamilton told the Long Island Pulse: “My doctor thought I was pretty much done with cancer that I had in ’06 and then it came back a few years later.</p><p>I was faced with losing my way of life if not my life. But there’s a guy here in Boston that Adele mentioned when she got her Grammy, Steven Zeitels, who does novel surgeries and was able to do a procedure that got cancer out of my throat without having to ruin the rest of it.”</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-919 data-method=placement-service></span><p>He continued, “I just saw him the other day and he said, ‘You beat this one. You can keep coming to see me if you want, but I don’t think you need to worry about this cancer coming back.’ I said, ‘I’ll come back to see you every six months from here until eternity if it’s alright with you!'”</p><p>In the past, Hamilton told The Pulse Of Radio that successfully battling cancer gave him a new appreciation for life. “Y’know, one of the ironic things is that, and it’s kind of a cliché, y’ know, about the little things in life, but I’m constantly noticing little pleasures like that,” he said. “And because y’ know, I’m pretty sure I’m cool, but you never know, you might go in there and they’ll say, ‘Oh, there’s some kind of trouble going on,’ so you really do put a priority on enjoying the stuff that’s right in front of you.”</p><p>Hamilton’s replacement at the Aerosmith shows that he missed while receiving cancer treatment was David Hull, who has stood in for him on previous Aerosmith tours.</p><p>Aerosmith’s latest effort, 2012’s Music From Another Dimension!, debuted at No. 5 on The Billboard 200 album chart, selling 63,000 copies in its first week of release. The group’s previous collection of new songs, 2001’s “Just Push Play”, entered the chart at No. 2 with sales of 240,000 copies.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-920 data-method=placement-service></span><h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Tom Hamilton</h2><h3><span id=Who_is_XYZAll_NamesAll_questions_in_H2>Who is Tom Hamilton?</span></h3><p>Hamilton is an American musician who is famously known for the hard rock band Aerosmith.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span><h3><span id=How_old_is_XYZAll_Names>How old is Tom Hamilton?&nbsp;</span></h3><p>Hamilton is an American national born on December 31, 1951, in Colorado Springs, Colorado.</p><h3><span id=How_tall_is_XYZAll_Names>How tall is Tom Hamilton?&nbsp;</span></h3><p><strong>Hamilton stands at a height of 6 feet 1 inch.</strong></p><h3><span id=Is_XYZ_marriedAll_Names>Is Tom Hamilton married?</span></h3><p>Yes, Hamilton is married to Terry Cohen.
