To find out more about her parents and siblings, continue reading.</strong></p><p>Jessica Mauboy is the stage name of Jessica Hilda Mauboy, an Australian actress, singer, and composer.</p><p>She originally became well-known in 2006 after placing second in the Australian Idol fourth season and signing a record contract with Sony Music Australia.</p><p>Mauboy has performed professionally both as an actor and as a musician. She won the AACTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for her notable roles in the movies Bran Nue Dae and The Sapphires.</p><p>In addition, she returned to acting in 2016 when she portrayed the lead role in the drama television series The Secret Daughter for two seasons.</p><p>It was mostly written with her in mind and was her first noteworthy TV role.</p><h2>Meet Sophia, Jenny, Catherine, and Sandra, Jessica Mauboy’s sisters</h2><p>Jessica Mauboy is not related to the claims circulating about her brother.</p><p>She has four sisters. Her younger sister Sophia, as well as her three older sisters, Jenny, Catherine, and Sandra.</p><p>Jessica enjoyed her early years as the youngest of four beautiful sisters. Sophia, her younger sister, plays soccer. Her elder sisters’ careers, however, have not been made public.</p><p>Since all of the sisters came from musical families, they were all interested in music from an early age.</p><p>Mauboy’s sisters take care of her quite well, so she doesn’t miss having a brother. They constantly adore and encourage her, and they guard her like brothers.</p><p>The four sisters have a beautiful link and a close relationship. They have always helped one other out when things become tough.</p><p>Furthermore, the sibling’s team is too fond of each other, acting more like a bunch of friends than sisters.</p><p>Jessica is blessed to have sisters who are so kind and kind, and who never let her feel alone or unloved. Her life is now filled with love and pleasure thanks to them.</p><p>As a result, the rumors circulating Jessica Mauboy’s brother are untrue.</p><h2>Jessica Mauboy’s Family History</h2><p>On August 4, 1989, Jessica Mauboy was born in Darwin, Northern Territory. As of right now, she is 34 years old.</p><p>Her mother, Therese Mauboy, was born in Australia, while her father, Fredy Mauboy, was born in Indonesia.</p><p>Jessica’s mother sings in the local church, while her father works as an electrician from West Timor.</p><p>From an early age, Mauboy and her grandmother, Harriett, participated actively in the local church choir.</p><p>Her family’s passion for music was also visible throughout their home, earning them the nickname “noisiest house on the block” from their neighbors.</p><p>Her father was a guitarist, her mother was a frequent singer, and other family members performed.</p><p>Moreover, she grew up with a strong passion for singing due to her familial musical background. They helped her pursue her dream of becoming a musician.</p><p>Similarly, she has been greatly driven by the support she has received from her family, who have always been by her side.</p><p>At the 2004 Tamworth Country Music Festival in Tamworth, New South Wales, Mauboy’s abilities were found at the age of fourteen via the Telstra Road to Tamworth competition.</p><p>She also went to Sydney to compete as the first-ever winner of the tournament.</p><p>She released a country-inspired rendition of Cyndi Lauper’s “Girls Just Wanna Have Fun.” The song’s music video was developed and released, but it was a commercial failure, and Mauboy moved to Darwin.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Jonathan Groff, Who Is Out Gay, Discusses A Relationship Gone Wrong"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":36992,"10":2,"15":"Arial","18":1}' data-sheets-hyperlink=https://popularbio.com/jonathan-groff-who-is-out-gay-discusses-a-relationship-gone-wrong/ data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/jonathan-groff-who-is-out-gay-discusses-a-relationship-gone-wrong/"}{"1":78}'><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Also Read: </a><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Jonathan Groff, Who Is Out Gay, Discusses A Relationship Gone Wrong</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Australian actress</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Singer</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Meet James Dutton Son John Dutton And Daughter Elsa Dutton, His Wife Margaret And Family Members</a></h3>When his family settled in Montana, John Dutton, the son of James Dutton, was still a little kid.After months of anticipation, The Duttons have finally taken over our screens.
