Lisa Gallant, Itzin’s agent, confirmed his demise. Itzin had a “severe heart attack” in 2015 while performing Shakespeare, but, according to Gallant, she “came back only to continue to thrive in theater, film, and TV.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>“Only his passion for his family surpassed his enthusiasm for the arts. Greg was married to the love of his life, Judie, for 43 years. They had two children, Wilke (also an actor) and Julia (an artist), who were his pride and joy, as well as Wylder Gregory, his beloved grandson “she claimed in the statement, according to PEOPLE. His sister Pamela, niece Deidre and nephew Aaron, great-niece Claire and nephew Cole, as well as his son and grandson, spent his final days with them in the Midwest.</p><p style=text-align:justify>“It is impossible to put into words the life of a man lived to the fullest,” wrote Itzin’s son Wilke Itizin in a moving social media homage to his father. The author claimed, in part, “My dad was known over the world as a fantastic actor with a body of work that would beat most famous actors portfolios.” He has been in a wide range of shows, including Friends, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Mork and Mindy, and of course 24’s infamous president.</p><p style=text-align:justify>“But he was best known for his outstanding stage performances, which were witnessed by a large audience. When I saw him perform in Donald Margulies’ one-man play Shipwrecked, I was shocked and in awe to realize that it was my father. Even as he was passing away, he could still recite Shakespeare like he had just made up the phrases because he was so in love with the theater “, he went on. “We will never spend enough time together, in my opinion. I truly don’t know what I’d do without you, Pops, and I love you very much. Everyone loved you, and we will all miss you terribly. I’m glad we got to spend these last few days together despite how sad it makes me feel “Wilke wrapped up his message.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The executive producer of “24,” Jon Cassar, also paid respect to Itizen. He revealed, “My friend Greg Itzin passed away today. In addition to being one of the most gifted performers I’ve ever had the pleasure of working with, he was also a really nice guy. His 24 family members, who had nothing but love and respect for him, would miss him, the man continued. “You left your mark; now, friend, rest in peace.”</p><h3 style=text-align:justify>Greg Itzin, a friend of mine, passed away tonight</h3><p style=text-align:justify>He was one of the most gifted actors I’ve ever had the pleasure of working with, but he was also just a really cool man. His 24 family members, who had nothing but love and respect for him, will miss him. Rest in peace, friend. You left your mark.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Alan Spencer, a producer and screenwriter, wrote: “I’m deeply grieved to hear about Gregory Itzin’s passing as an actor. Greg was cast in a short-lived sitcom by Mel Brooks and me, where he competed favorably with seasoned actors like Harvey Korman and Cloris Leachman. Greg and I used to work together, and I always looked forward to seeing him every day.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>I’m deeply grieved to hear of Gregory Itzin’s passing as an actor.

Never again will I forget our time together.</p><h3 style=text-align:justify>Career of Itzin</h3><p style=text-align:justify>Itzin was raised in Wisconsin after being born in Washington, DC, and she later attended the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco. In the 1979 miniseries Backstairs at the White House, he had his on-screen debut (uncredited), and in the 1980 film Airplane!, he had a brief cameo as “Religious Zealot #1,” giving a flower to Julie Hagerty’s flight attendant as she passes by in the terminal.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Among Itzin’s many television credits are “Charlie’s Angels,” “Party of Five,” and “Big Love.” He also worked on three Star Trek series: “Deep Space Nine,” “Voyager,” and “Enterprise” for mega-producer Steven Bochco, as well as “Hill Street Blues,” “L.A. Law,” “Murder One,” and “NYPD Blue.” He also played Mike Hannigan’s (Paul Rudd) father in the Friends episode, and he had regular appearances on “Covert Affairs” and “The Mentalist.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrHDmpummpqisG%2B1zWieq52XpL%2B6ecitsaKmXWh8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./hallmark-channels-most-iconic-hanukkah-movies-ranked.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hallmark Channels Most Iconic Hanukkah Movies, Ranked">&larr;
