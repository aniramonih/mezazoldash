But unlike others, <strong>Wenwen Han</strong> has continued to prove herself as a prominent actress in the Chinese entertainment industry.</p><p>Still, don’t know who is Wenwen Han? Han is a Chinese actress who rose to fame after her appearance in The Karate Kid alongside <strong>Jackie Chan</strong> and <strong>Jaden Smith</strong>. She stormed the movie industry with her charm and stole the hearts of many. But this child actress in the movie is no kid at this point. Her beauty and charisma are blowing the Chinese movie industry by storm.</p><p>So, let’s know more about this gorgeous actress and her life and what she has been up to.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/wenwen-0001.jpg><p>Here are some interesting facts about Wenwen Han.</p><h2>Wenwen Han: Quick Facts</h2><table class=table><tbody><tr><th>Full Name</th><td>Wenwen Han</td></tr><tr><th>Date of Birth</th><td>August 24, 1995</td></tr><tr><th>Age</th><td>25 years</td></tr><tr><th>Birthplace</th><td>Xian, China</td></tr><tr><th>Nationality</th><td>Chinese</td></tr><tr><th>Ethnicity</th><td>Asian</td></tr><tr><th>Horoscope</th><td>Virgo</td></tr><tr><th>Eye color</th><td>Black</td></tr><tr><th>Hair color</th><td>Black</td></tr><tr><th>Build</th><td>Slim</td></tr><tr><th>Height</th><td>5 feet 5 inches(165cm)</td></tr><tr><th>Profession</th><td>Actress, Singer</td></tr><tr><th>Marital Status</th><td>Single</td></tr><tr><th>Social Media</th><td><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Early Life and Education</h2><p>The beautiful actress Han was born on August 24, 1995, in Xian, China. Her zodiac sign is Virgo. Born in China, Han holds Chinese nationality and belongs to Asian ethnicity. The name of Wen’s parents is not known to the media. Not only the parent’s name but the sibling’s information is also a far cry.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tyler Lee Bennington Age, Parents, Siblings, Twitter, Wiki-Bio >></a></h4><p>Since Han was born during high inflation and several earthquakes, there is not much information about her education either. Amidst all of the catastrophe, it is hard to bring the educational details. But at this point, the way she has carried herself shows the fact she is highly educated.&nbsp; This statement is proved by the fact that the diva is well close to Mandarin, Cantonese, and English languages.</p><h2>Age and Measurements</h2><p>As of today, The Karate Kid actress is 25&nbsp;years old. She is 5 feet 5 inches(165 cm) tall and weighs around 45 kg(100 lbs). She has shed her innocent image from the movie and is now a gorgeous lady. Han has a curvy figure of 29-24-31 inches. As per her sun sign, she is practical and systematic at the same time.</p><p>Similarly, Han has beautiful black eyes with long black hair. Also, she has an oval-shaped face with high cheekbones, which gives an adult look. Moreover, the slim body figure is the result of the hard work put in the gym along with a healthy diet.</p><h2>Wenwen Han: The Karate Kid</h2><p>From an early age, Han had an interest in dance and music, and as a result, she attended a school of percussion for a specified period. There she mastered to play percussions, guitar, and many other instruments. After that, Han performed in many festivals and local partied in her hometown, earning a name for herself. With music coming to her from an early age, the love for dance never went off, and she continuously immersed in it by adding acting too.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sara Martins Biography- Age, Career, Movies, Husband, Net Worth, IG >></a></h4><p>But her big break came in 2010 when she was cast to play <strong>Meiying</strong> in the remake of 1984, The Karate Kid. The movie starred many prominent actors, including <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Jackie Chan</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Taraji P. Henson</strong></a>, Jaden Smith, and<strong> Zhenwei Wang</strong>, and was directed by <strong>Harald Zwart</strong>. The film was shot in Beijing, China, where she played the love interest of Jaden Smith. The movie was a huge hit and grossed over <strong>$359.1 million</strong> in the box office.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/wenwen-0004.jpg><p>Following the success, Wenwen was established as one of the most sought out actresses in the Chinese entertainment industry and internationally. However, the actress took a break from her acting career to focus more on her musical career. After a long pause, the actress was seen in a recent movie, Ink, and Rain, as the Female VIP. Added to that, a work in series Hai Mei Ai Gou is also the mentionable one. Most of her works are seen in the Chinese periphery, where she feels more comfortable with things.</p><p>So far, she has been doing well as a percussionist performing in top musical shows and festivals around Asia. We feel that music will take her acting works over, but we will let readers know every new change.</p><h2>Wenwen Han: Personal Life and Married</h2><p>Talking about her love life, Wenwen is single as of today. She is determined and focused on her musical career more than anything. However, 25- year-old actress is often mistaken for another Chinese actress Han Wenwen who is married.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jonathan Osteen Biography- Age, Wife, College, Preaching, Instagram >></a></h4><p>But we can say with assurance that Wen is single and is enjoying her freedom. Besides, the young actress spends her spare time with family and friends, leaving no time to date. With all the new works and the beauty coming off age, we feel she will find a handsome hunk pretty soon.</p><h2>Wenwen Han: Net Worth and Income</h2><p>After getting shot to fame from her debut movie, Wen Wen took a long break from the acting work. Recently some of her Chinese works have come through. Due to the stop-start work in film, it is hard to tell about this diva’s net worth. We feel it is around <strong>$100k</strong>.</p><p>As she has taken a long break from the acting work, the information on the annual income and assets owned is also on the hidden side. If something pops out, we will let readers know about it.</p><h2>Social Media Presence</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Instagram</a>– 76k Followers</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Twitter</a>–&nbsp; 17.7k Followers</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmispqi1sMPSrZirq16YvK571p6lsJ2eYrWiuoyboKifopa9qcWMmp6eZaSdsm63wKuYrZ1doLalecyaqauhlZl6r7HTZq6oqqSdeqq60q2YoKqRonw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-are-the-recess-voice-actors-doing-now.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What are the Recess voice actors doing now?">&larr;
